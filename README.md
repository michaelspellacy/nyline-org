# NYLine: The New York Star Wars Line Archive

A long time ago on a sidewalk far, far away...

A bunch of Star Wars nerds got together for the geek event of the century. This is their story.

Serving the greater New York "Star Wars" community since 1999, NYLine celebrated the release of the prequel trilogy as a benefit for the Starlight Children's Foundation. Witness how we fulfilled our destinies with a sidewalk line party like no other in the shadow of New York's Ziegfeld theater, counting down the days to the premieres of Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace in 1999, Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones in 2002 and Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith in 2005!

Enjoy and May The Force Be With You!
