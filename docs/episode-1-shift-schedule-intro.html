<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>W</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>e want Star Wars fans to
be lined up 1 month in advance of the opening day. Not everyone can be
there all the time of course! However our aim is to have a constant presence
in front of the theater. At any time of the day, we should have a couple
of fans out there raising awareness for both Episode 1 and for the Starlight
Foundation. Thus we want the line manned at all times, ideally at least
3-4 people. </FONT></P>

<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>E</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>ach shift is associated
with a number of points (the more difficult the shift, the higher the points).
Difficulty has been dictated by the following factors: date, time and duration.
In order to be eligible for tickets to any or both of the shows, members
will have to accumulate a minimum of 10 points. The point system will give
equal chances to anyone wishing to qualify for a ticket. </FONT></LI>

the minimum is neither too hard nor too easy. Besides, the timing and duration
of each shift should allow everyone to take part in this event whether
one is a professional or student working/studying full-time or part-time.
