				<p><b>1.</b> Sign up for shifts on this website and print out the forms
			that are generated. You must send your signed waiver and a $15 postal money order
			(made out to NYLine Countdown) to:</p>
			
				<p>
			<b>NYLine Countdown<br>
			244 Fifth Avenue<br>
			Suite 2808<br>			
			New York, NY 10001
			</b></p>

				<p>You will not be able to stand on line until NYLine receives your signed waiver.
			The waiver shows you are lining up with us of your own volition, and that 
			neither NYLine nor any of its sponsors can be held responsible for any situation 
			that might occur during the line.</p>

				<p><b>2.</b> For insurance purposes, NYLine is limited to 350 members. Once we reach 350,
			you will be locked out of the signup process. If you would like your name to be
			added to a waiting list, email 
				<a href="mailto:waitlist@nyline.org?subject=NYLine Waiting List Request">waitlist@nyline.org</a>.  
			You will be notified by email if an opening becomes available. The waiting list will be 
			operated on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

				<p><b>3.</b> You must sign up for enough shifts to earn 45 points to receive your ticket for
			the midnight show. If you fail to meet this minimum requirement, you will not get a 
			ticket, and the money you sent in will be donated to the Starlight Children's Foundation. 
			Individual shifts are limited to 25 scheduled line members.</p>


				<p><b>4.</b> All minors must have a parent or legal guardian sign the NYLine waiver. Line members 
			aged 16 and 17 must have a working contact number for a parent or guardian at all times, 
			and must be accompanied during overnight shifts by a parent or guardian, or an adult 
			sibling who is also a registered line member. Line members aged 15 and under must be 
			accompanied at all times by a parent or guardian, or an adult sibling who is also a 
			registered line member. While NYLine staff members and shift bosses bear no responsibility 
			for the actions of minors on the line, if minors are present during school hours or 
			during overnight shifts, NYLine reserves the right to notify parents or guardians of 
			your whereabouts.</p> 

				<p><b>5.</b> You are required to sign-in with a NYLine staff member or shift boss at the beginning
			and end of each of your scheduled shifts. Failure to sign in or show up for a scheduled 
			shift will result in the points from that shift being deducted from your total points. 
			If extenuating circumstances occur, please notify a <a href="mailto:info@nyline.org">NYLine staff member</a>; 
			shift rescheduling will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

				<p><b>6.</b> Shifts will be held rain or shine, so be sure to check the weather and make sure you are 
			dressed appropriately.  We will have an 8' x 8' canopy erected, but we cannot guarantee that
			everybody will fit under it. Also, because the Ziegfeld is in midtown Manhattan, it 
			receives very little direct sunlight except during the late morning and early 
			afternoon hours, and evenings can get downright cold. Being improperly dressed for 
			the weather is not a valid excuse for failing to complete your shift, so plan 
			accordingly.</p>

				<p><b>7.</b> If you're signed in and are nowhere to be found, you run the risk of losing the points for
			that shift. Going to the restroom or getting carryout from a neighborhood restaurant are 
			fine, as long as you are coming straight back to the line.</p>

				<p><b>8.</b> You will be given an NYLine badge when you sign in for your first shift. Please wear it 
			at all times when you are on the line. Do not lose this badge - you will not get a 
			replacement, and you must have the badge to collect your ticket and enter the Ziegfeld 
			with the NYLine members May 15.</p>

				<p><b>9.</b> You are welcome to show up for as many unscheduled shifts as you would like; however,
			points earned for unscheduled shifts will not count toward the 45 necessary to earn your 
			ticket. They will, however, count toward priority seating and/or prizes, so you are 
			encouraged to spend as much time at the line as possible. You must sign in for 
			unscheduled shifts if you want these points included in your total.</p>

				<p><b>10.</b> The Ziegfeld no longer has assigned seating, but the NYLine is going to attempt to 
			assign priority seating based on the number of earned points. (We say attempt because this 
			requires the total cooperation of the Ziegfeld, which is not assured at this point).</p>

				<p><b>11.</b>	We are the guests of the Ziegfeld and their landlords, Fisher Brothers.  Please act
			like good guests so we will be asked back again for Episode III. You are expected to obey
			the following rules:
			
			<blockquote class="bodytxt">

					<li>Possession and/or consumption of illegal drugs or alcohol are strictly prohibited.<br><br></li>
					<li>No microphones, PA systems or loud portable stereos.</li>
					<li>Do not block/obstruct sidewalk or street traffic while in line. Whether you are sitting on a chair or standing around, please stay on the inside of the sidewalk, away from the street side.<br><br></li>
					<li>Stay away from the southeast wall of the Fisher Bros. building (formerly "Labels for Less").  We will designate the area the NYLine is allowed to occupy.<br><br></li>
					<li>While it's OK to politely solicit donations from people walking down 54th street, please do not harass anybody if they don't contribute. Many of these people are employees of the Fisher Brothers or neighbors of the Ziegfeld, and we want to maintain a good relationship with them.<br><br></li>
					<li>Do not scalp your ticket. In addition to being illegal, it's an affront to your fellow line members and the Starlight Children's Foundation.<br><br></li>
					<li>Obey all requests made by Fisher Brothers security and NYPD officers.<br><br></li>
					<li>Do not give away Episode II spoilers. People who manage to avoid plot details, photos and the soundtrack by April 27 are consciously going out of their way to see the film unspoiled. Please respect them by keeping spoiler conversations away from the line or at a very low volume.<br><br></li>

			</blockquote>
			
			<p class="messagetxt"><b>Failure to comply with these rules, or any others deemed necessary by NYLine 
			staff or shift bosses, will result in your ejection from the line and the loss 
			of your ticket.</b></p> 

				<p><b>12.</b> If a member of the media requests an interview, remember that you are a 
			representative of the NYLine and the Starlight Children's Foundation. We won't tell
			you what you can and can't say, but we urge you to conduct yourself in a manner 
			that reflects positively upon your fellow line members and upon Starlight. 
			Please be sure to make some mention of the Starlight Children's Foundation. 
			Also, reporters may ask you to quote lines, stage a lightsaber battle, or perform 
			other stereotypic "sci-fi geek" antics. We won't ask you to censor yourselves or 
			your behavior, but know that you are representing both our charity and "Star Wars" 
			fans worldwide.</p>

				<p><b>13.</b> As mentioned above: NYLine members will probably be seated by priority 
			based on a combination of line hours (points) and money raised for Starlight.  
			If you get extra tickets for family and friends, please know that they will not 
			be able to sit in the area designated for NYLine members.   If you choose to give 
			up your priority seat to sit with non-member friends and family, then you will 
			take your chances with the general public and the NYLine will not be responsible 
			for your seating.  If you do have friends or family who want to attend the 
			midnight screening and sit with you, encourage them to become NYLine members. 
			It is likely that NYLine members will be allowed in the theater before the 
			general public, so you will get separated from non-member friends.  The NYLine 
			must know as early as possible if you choose to give up your priority seat. 

				<p><b>14.</b> NYLine organizers plan to have regular informational meetings/discussions 
			with everyone in line, so that everyone knows what's going on and can discuss 
			issues or problems. If you ever have a question, a problem, or a suggestion, 
			any of the Organizers will be more than happy to listen to you and help out to 
			the best of our abilities.

				<p><b>15.</b> Any items you bring with you are your responsibility, not ours. If you 
			leave anything behind (either when you go home, or when you leave a shift), we 
			bear no liability for said items. We will, of course, be watching out for one 
			another while in line, but no one can be everywhere or see everything at once, 
			so be sure you have everything you want to take with you if and when you leave.

				<p><b>16.</b> Please contact info@nyline.org if you have any questions.

				<p><b>17.</b> Have fun spending time in line with your fellow Star Wars fans and 
			enjoy "Attack of the Clones."

			<p class="headertxt"><b>TICKET DAY</b></p>

				<p>The NYLine is not a line for advance ticketing at the Ziegfeld box office. 
			The NYLine tickets will be set aside before the box office opens to the 
			general public, and our presence at the Ziegfeld will be to raise money and 
			awareness for the Starlight Children's Foundation. NYLine members will 
			receive one ticket to the first show, providing they have met the minimum 
			point requirements stated above. When advance tickets go on sale, NYLine will 
			not be "in line" for tickets, but we will continue to work for Starlight.  If 
			you are signed up for a shift that happens to fall on ticket day, you still 
			need to show up and sign in, but if you want to buy advance tickets from the 
			Ziegfeld box office, we ask that you go to the end of the line. Being an 
			NYLine member DOES NOT mean you can automatically cut to the front of the 
			advance ticket line!  If you are not signed up for a shift on ticket day and 
			desire extra tickets, you will be required to wait with the general public to 
			acquire the extra tickets. We believe that security will be extra tight this 
			year and we want to make sure that line members don't abuse the privileges 
			Fisher Brothers and the Ziegfeld have given us. Anybody caught line jumping 
			on ticket day will be ejected from NYLine, they will revoke the right to 
			their ticket to the first show, and their money will be donated to Starlight.</p>

				<p><b>Rules for the NYLine-a-Thon to benefit the Starlight Children's Foundation:</b></p>

				<p><b>1.</b> NYLine members are strongly encouraged to download the Starlight 
			NYLine-a-Thon forms and get people to sponsor you for the time you spend on 
			line.  We have stated on our website and in news releases that we hope to 
			raise enough money to purchase at least five Fun Centers for area hospitals.  
			We can reach this goal if every line member raises just $50! Help us reach 
			that goal by signing up friends, family members and co-workers to sponsor you 
			for the time you spend in line.</p>

				<p><b>2.</b> The NYLine-a-Thon will begin with the first shift on Saturday April 27, 
			and hours will be tallied through 1 p.m. on Sunday, May 12. This will give you 
			two full days to collect your contributions. Only contributions turned in 
			by 9 p.m. Tuesday May 14 will count towards premiums and prizes.</p>

				<p><b>3.</b> Please encourage your sponsors to give all lump-sum contributions in 
			advance, so you can focus on collecting the hourly donations once the 
			NYLine-a-Thon has ended.</p>

				<p><b>4.</b> Be sure to ask your sponsors if their company has a matching gift 
			program. Many companies match the donations given by their employees. Also, 
			please check with your employer to see if your company will match your 
			donation and/or the money you raise.</p>

				<p><b>5.</b> All NYLine members who raise at least $50 for the Starlight Children's 
			Foundation will receive an exclusive NYLine t-shirt, or a prize of equal value. 
			These t-shirts/prizes will only be available only to people who present at least 
			$50 for Starlight.</p>

				<p><b>6.</b> The people who raise the most money for Starlight will be eligible 
			for special prizes. A presentation of these prizes and an announcement of the 
			top fund-raisers will be held at the Ziegfeld before the curtain goes up for the 
			midnight show.</p>
