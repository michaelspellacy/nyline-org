NEW YORK LINE FOR STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH BACK AT THE ZIEGFELD THEATER!

Stand-a-Thon for 19 Days will Benefit Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation

WHO: 
NYLine, an all-volunteer partnership formed to celebrate the release of the Star Wars prequels will assemble approximately 
350 Star Wars fans from the New York City tri-state area and around the world for a three-week Stand-a-Thon benefiting the 
Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation.

WHAT: 
The Stand-a-Thon will be a New York-flavored celebration for the three weeks leading to the opening of the final film in the 
Star Wars saga, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Sponsors will pledge donations to the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation for 
every hour NYLine members spend on the sidewalk near the Ziegfeld Theater.

WHY: 
The highly publicized NYLine Stand-a-Thons at the Ziegfeld in 1999 and 2002 raised more than $33,000 in cash and product 
donations for Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation. Since 1999, NYLine was always intended to be more than just the means to acquire 
opening day tickets for the new Star Wars films. The media frenzy and public interest surrounding the Star Wars prequels have allowed
NYLine to raise money and awareness for the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation, whose mission is to brighten the lives of 
critically, chronically and terminally ill children throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

WHERE:
Ziegfeld Theater, 141 West 54th St, New York, NY.

WHEN: 
April 30 to the midnight opening of Episode III, May 19, 2005.
