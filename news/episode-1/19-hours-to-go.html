	<p>As morning breaks across the Manhattan skyline, "Star Wars" fans outside the Ziegfeld Theatre ready themselves for the most anxiously awaited event of the past 16 years.</p>

	<p>The festivities will start around 1 p.m., when the Sci-Fi Channel's Sci Fi Lounge will open. Jack and Carol Serra, the Luke and Leia of the Sci Fi Lounge, will be welcoming fans with pens, t-shirts, and other assorted gifts and prizes.</p>

	<p>Ticket disbursal will begin promptly at 6 p.m., wrapping up by 9 p.m. On hand will be representatives of Kay Bee Toy & Hobby, who will ask trivia questions and award "Star Wars" related prizes to anybody who happens to drop by the theater.</p>

	<p>At 9 p.m., the NYLine will conduct an auction of some unique memorabilia, including an animation cell from the "Droids" television series, several autographed items, and the long-awaited limited edition NYLine t-shirts. Be sure to bring your wallets; all the proceeds from the auction benefit the Starlight Children's Foundation.</p>

	<p>Yomega Yo-Yo masters Dan and Ryan will also drop by to offer some last-minute yo-yo lessons (and perhaps, one more contest).</p>

	<p>Following the auction, NYLiners will enter the Ziegfeld Theatre, where shortly after midnight, the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare will sound, giving way to those long awaited words:</p>

	<p>"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."</p>
