title: 24-Hour Lineup To Begin Tomorrow
theme: episode-1
---

	<p>Tomorrow, the countdown begins in earnest.</p>

	<p>Because of an agreement with Clearview Cinemas, the owner of the Ziegfeld Theater, the NYLine has been operating from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. since May 1.</p>

	<p>As of Friday, the NYLine will be camped in front of the Ziegfeld 24/7 until the premiere of "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"!</p>

	<p>Because the line will be operating around the clock, we will be able to offer more extensive coverage, as we will not have to tear down and store Echo Base every night. That means 24-hour viewing via our webcam, as well as several new features that can be accessed on this web site. Stop on by the Ziegfeld or at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000229234552/http://www.voila.com">www.voila.com</a> to see all the latest events... the fun is just beginning!</p>
