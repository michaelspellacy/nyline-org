title: 40 Die-Hard Fans Kick Off NYLine Festivities
theme: episode-1
---

	<p>Armed with everything from lawn chairs to lightsabers and decked out in attire ranging from winter coats to Jedi robes, 40 die-hard fans descended on Midtown Manhattan's Ziegfeld Theater to begin the 18-day countdown to "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace."</p> 

	<p>Shortly after 8 a.m., Line Coordinator Robert Cartagena held up a sign reading "The Line Starts Here" before the cheering crowd. For the next half- hour, NYLine committee members Michele Hadlow and Amit Saxena greeted the line members, checking them in and issuing badges to identify them as official NYLine members.</p>

	<p>As NYLine committee members attended to the business of getting the line up and running, representatives of the media arrived. By 10:30 a.m., reporters from the New York Post, the Village Voice, and Entertainment Tonight had requested interviews from resident PR Princess Suzanne Sousa, and two documentary film crews were capturing the festivities. In addition, the NYLine began its own broadcast via live webcam, which can be viewed at www.voila.com.</p> 
	<p>The NYLine kickoff is merely the beginning of the day's events. This afternoon, the NYLine will be producing its own take on "The Dating Game" (with an obvious "Star Wars" twist), and representatives from Yomega Yo-Yo will be handing out free Yo-Yos and conducting a Ultimate Yo-Yo workshop.</p>
