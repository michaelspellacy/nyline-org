	<p>Yes, well we are back and mostly recovered from our collective experiences. We have promised to keep this site updated periodically with the continuing saga of NYLine Countdown. We will be monitoring the site from the time and posting the latest developments where Episode I stands in the record books and hopefully where the line for Episode II will start. Steve Lorenzo, Mike Gent, Matthew Simantov and Michael "Spell" Spellacy (if they are willing, hint hint) will be the ones handling the site. If you have any comments or suggestions please send them to <a href="mailto:nyline99@hotmail.com">nyline99@hotmail.com</a></p>
