	<p>Yes, we have made it another night and if you been following our updates if has been an interesting weekend.</p>

	<p>Insanity prevailed in the wee hours this morning as the NYLiners were paid a visit by Star Wars Man (just a sleep deprived liner really). We are all a little sleep deprived at this point (I personally have not been off this line since Friday at 5:00pm). Just wanted to let you know we are still alive (barely) and ready to change shifts.</p>
