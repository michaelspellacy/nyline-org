	<p>Well I have decided to take on the responsibility for making our Line Contact List, for members of the NYLine to keep in contact with each other.</p>

	<p>I may make a public contact list, with just names and e-mail addresses. Or a private one available by E-mail containing names, addresses, phone numbers, etc...</p>

	<p>Either way there will be an area for a small comment or special instruction with each name.</p>

	<p>For now send whatever contact info you want to be posted and if you want a public or private list to: <a href="mailto:LineList@hotmail.com">LineList@hotmail.com</a></p>

	<p>Send me any questions you might have to <a href="mailto:rancid@interport.net">rancid@interport.net</a></p>
