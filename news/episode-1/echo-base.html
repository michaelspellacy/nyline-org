	<p>This is the communications hub of the New York Line. Courtesy of Voila, this spacious van houses two computers, a printer, phone, a web cam, ladder, 7 rolls of duct tape, and three very tired fans. Of course, the opportunity to go behind the scenes (and to relax inside a nice quiet van) is a welcome change of pace.</p>
