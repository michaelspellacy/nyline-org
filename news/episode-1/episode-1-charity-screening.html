	<p>Spell here. It sure has been a while! I just wanted to give you all a heads up that some of the ol' NYLine folk will be getting together tomorrow night for the Episode I Charity Screening!</p>

	<p>If you want to relive the magic of lining up on a (cold) New York city street corner and are interested in attending, please <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact me</a>.</p>

	<p>It'll be a "blast" to see some of you again! Nyuck nyuck nyuck!</p>

	<p>May The Force Be With You! Next stop...<em>Episode II!</em></p>
