	<p>Just a tiny update for the rabid fans who are still up in the wee small hours of the night...</p>

	<p>We began our graveyard shift this evening by hooking up the Nintendo 64 and playing a few rounds of Rouge Squadron (cool game...I highly recommend it).</p>

	<p>We are currently watching the Star Wars Special Edition out on the street. Strange experience watching television out on the sidewalk...</p>

	<p>Well, that's all for now.</p>

	<p>May the Force be with us!!</p>
