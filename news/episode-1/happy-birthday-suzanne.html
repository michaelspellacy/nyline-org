<p>As many of you may know, our PR Princess Suzanne Sousa celebrated her birthday on the line last night.</p>

<p>Shortly before midnight, a crowd descended on the line, bearing gifts and a sheet cake featuring a Darth Maul action figure and an airbrushed picture of a lightsaber duel.</p>

<p>Suzanne received gifts from many NYLine participants, including a Queen Amidala poster and matching paper doll book, a Darth Maul inflatable chair, and two collector's watches -- a limited edition "Empire Strikes Back" with collector's card, and a Fossil Darth Vader watch that came with a ceramic case the shape of Vader's helmet.</p>

<p>The party also launched the line's first scheduled graveyard shift. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the line is now 24/7 until the premiere showing of Episode I at the Ziegfeld!</p>
