<p>As some of you already know, I had the opportunity to see Episode 1 last Tuesday at the Astor Plaza.</p>

<p>Well, I've had a couple of days to think about what I saw and to let it all sink in (My shattered brain has been pieced back together - thanks to those of you who have asked).</p>

<p>Originally I wasn't going to post a single smidge of information (I'm still not - a promise is a promise and my lips are sealed) and then I read <a href="the-real-phantom-menace.html">Jason's post</a> yesterday afternoon. Some people are getting overly defensive at any negative review of this movie. That is fine. They are entitled to their opinions...and I am entitled to mine...</p>

	<li>When the lights go down and the 20th Century Fox logo appears...and you then realize what you are about to see...<em>A NEW STAR WARS ADVENTURE</em>...in a theater...among friends...you will hopefully feel like a kid again. I did. When you are in this state...try to stay that way for another two hours. Actually, just do it - there is no try!</li>
	<li>Keep in mind that Lucas has stated many times that these new movies will deal heavily with political intrigue, friendship and betrayal. It is also a different era in the Star Wars universe...the Jedi Knights are the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy. There is no <em>rebellion against an Empire</em> taking place so you can't really compare this movie to the others...it's not <em>quite</em> like them. If you go in comparing movies, well, you probably won't enjoy it. How can you enjoy it...if you are sitting there comparing it to Empire? Hello? Empire rules! Yes, this is a different Star Wars movie...but for some I suspect it will take a little getting use to.</li>
</ol>

<p>Go in with this understanding and you will enjoy this movie. <em>Trust me</em>. Anyway...<em>Star Wars is back!</em></p>
