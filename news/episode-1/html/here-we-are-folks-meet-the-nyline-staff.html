<p>We have received a tremendous reponse for the NYLine. Though shifts are closed we will promise all NYLiners a special bonus (to be announced soon) so stay tuned. You will be notified within the next two days or so of receipt of your waivers and money orders and will be given, a reference number, which you must have when lining up.</p>

<p>Just in case you were wondering who we are, here is a picture of us at our last meeting at Voila.com's headquarters here in mid-town Manhattan.</p>
