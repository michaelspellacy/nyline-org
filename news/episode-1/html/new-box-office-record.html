<p>Greetings Line Fanatics! <em>Star Wars is back! Oh Yeah!</em></p>

<p>Although I can't be at today's screening of Episode 1 with my fellow staff & line members I just wanted to let you know that my heart is with you.</p>

<p>Robert, Suzanne, Ariel, Matt, Steve, Gio...thanks for making this a most memorable experience for all who have been involved!! I'm looking forward to working with you guys (hopefully) on <em>"Countdown to Episode II"</em> (I've already started the website for it...call me!)</p>

<p>Now for the news...if you haven't heard already, a source over at the <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">Drudge Report</a> claims that Episode I has raked in an estimated $45 million dollars in ticket sales for it's first day alone. If the report is true then that would make it the <em><strong>biggest</strong> opening in a single day</em>!</p>

<p>Cool! <q>"Iceberg straight ahead!"</q> And I think the writing on it may say "Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace"!</em> Stay tuned for more...</p>
