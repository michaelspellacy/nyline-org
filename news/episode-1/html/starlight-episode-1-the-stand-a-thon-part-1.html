<p>Many of you have asked me and other NYLine organizers about the policy for submitting your Starlight pledges. Beginning on May 18th, NYLine members may hand deliver pledge sheets along with cash, checks or money orders to me - If you don't know <a href="/fan-of-the-day/suzanne-sousa.html">what I look like</a>, just ask around 'cause someone is bound to recognize me :). For those of you who will finish collecting your pledges after May 19th, please mail your pledge sheets along with checks and/or money orders to the Starlight Children's Foundation office in Manhattan:

<p><strong>Starlight Children's Foundation NY-NJ-CT<br>1560 Broadway<br>Suite 600<br>New York, NY 10036<br>Attention: Michaela Potter</strong></p>

<p>Also keep in mind that NYLine Countdown will be auctioning off 5 NYLine T-shirts complete with the Statue of Liberty brandishing her very own lightsaber with all proceeds going to Starlight Children's Foundation NY*NJ*CT! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:zanazs5@yahoo.com">zanazs5@yahoo.com</a></p>
