<p><strong>Yes, it's true!</strong> After weeks of intense negotiations, we have finally reached an agreement with the one-and-only Ziegfeld theater. This luxuriously beautiful theater will be the official home of the New York Line. We're thrilled, and we're pretty sure that you are too...so let's work together to make this experience one for the history books!</p>

<ol>
	<li>We will <strong>NOT</strong> be starting the line on the 24th of April. The line will officially start on May Day, <strong>5/1/99</strong>. The point system has been modified accordingly to accomodate this change.</p>
	<li>Bathroom facilities will <strong>NOT</strong> be made available by the theater; however, we are making arrangements with local merchants to satisfy this most important need.</p>
	<li>For the first eight days of the line, shifts will be created to reflect a 17 hour day (from 8am to 1am). Starting on May 8th the shifts will be going on 24/7 until the big day.</p>  
</ol>

<p>So, there you have it folks. The dream has become a reality. Not only will we actually be lining up, we will actually be lining up in style, at the most prestigious movie house in the city (which, by the way, WILL be THX certified by movie-time).</p>

<h3>Line Quick Facts</h3>

<ul>
	<li><b>Where?</b> The Ziegfeld Theater</li>

<p>Do you think 3 weeks sounds like a long time? Think that things might get a little slow after the first few days (hours, minutes)? Not a chance! We've got all sorts of great stuff planned for line members...video games, 24-hour telecasts of the original (and Special Edition) trilogy, light-saber battles, role playing game sessions...if it's remotely Star Wars related, we will have it on the line! And if that's not enough, the entire event from start to finish is going to be broadcast live over the net (courtesty of France Telecom/Voila.com). So if you don't want to miss out on the fan event of the millenium, sign up now and reserve yourself a spot in entertainment history...</p>
