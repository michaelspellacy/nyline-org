	<p>This Sunday, May 16, beginning at 7:30 am, NYLine Countdown will be visited by Weekend Today and Channel 7 weather guy, <a href="../fan-of-the-day/lee-goldberg.html">Lee Goldberg</a>! So if you have a costume you want to show off, come EARLY to the place you all know so well! The Weekend Today talent really want people who really know the trilogy - do they really think we can't handle basic trivia questions? Also, the NYLine crew will assist Weatherman Goldberg in forecasting the weekday forecast - does it really matter what the weather will be like on May 19th? So if you can wake up before your fist hit of the snooze button, come on down to the place where things are always happening - NYLine Ziegfeld!</p>
