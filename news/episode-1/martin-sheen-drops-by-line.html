	<p>Actor and political activist Martin Sheen stopped by the NYLine Monday night to sign autographs and pose for pictures.</p>

	<p>When told that fans had been lining up since May 1, he said, "I've been in much shorter demonstrations."</p>

	<p>Sheen has been involved in many civil actions, including protests against homelessness, nuclear weapons, and ironically enough, the Strategic Defense Initiative (also known as "Star Wars").</p>

	<p>Perhaps best known for his role as Captain (not Commander) Willard in "Apocalypse Now," Sheen has appeared in more than 100 films and television shows. He is also the father of actors Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen.</p>
