	<p>I'm stopping by the line later this afternoon, but I can see now that we have rain again.</p>

	<p>The <abbr title="Digital Subscriber Line">DSL</abbr> is working fine now, and we'll try to run the webcam from the window of the van. Remember, until this friday we are only lined up from 10am-10pm EST. Starting this Friday we will be there 24/7 Also here is the number to the payphone near the line: 212-664-9764.</p>
