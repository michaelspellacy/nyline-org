	<p>The following news was supposed to go on our old site but since all of you are now redirected here when clicking on your bookmarks (or whatever), I am posting it here as well. Read on...</p>

	<p>We need to determine exact figures for the number of ticket holders attending the May 19 screenings. To help us in this, please send an email to nylineRSVP@hotmail.com. If you are planning to attend the 12:01a.m. screening, please put Midnight in the subject header; if you would prefer to attend the prime time (7 - 8 p.m.) screening, please put Prime Time in the subject header.</p>

	<p>If we have not received your signed waiver and money order by MAY 6,1999, you will not be guaranteed a ticket. If your mail was returned,please bring the waiver and money order to the Ziegfeld and give them to any Countdown NYC representative wearing a PINK badge. DO NOT send via US Postal Service Express Mail, UPS, FedEx or the like, as these carriers will not deliver to a Post Office Box. If it is physically or geographically impossible for you to get to the Ziegfeld before May 6, please email us so we can work out a solution.</p>

	<p>Also, for those of you who still don't know (although I can't imagine why ) what your shift schedule is please go here for the following info: http://acm.poly.edu/-reptile/nyl/shift2.cgi</p>

	<p>That's all for now. See all of you later for another glorious day of COUNTINGDOWN!</p>
