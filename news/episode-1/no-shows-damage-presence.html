	<p>Despite an apparent break in the weather, a good number of line members registered for the early afternoon shift to show up at the Ziegfeld.</p>

	<p>We must stress the importance of promptly showing up for your scheduled shift. Failure to do so results in a diluted presence, hurting our fund-raising efforts.</p>

	<p>As a reminder, if you miss two shifts without providing a legitimate excuse you forfeit your place in line, and the money you sent for tickets will be donated to the STARLIGHT CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION.</p>

	<p>Many people willing to put in time have signed a waiting list; if you are on the waiting list check back with the website for announcements as line positions become available.</p>

	<p>We would like to extend a hearty thanks to those who have braved the weather to fulfill their shifts. We are also looking to those who have already signed on and completed shifts to please consider adding more to your schedule to help fill out understaffed shifts. Line members earning the most points will be eligible for prizes and preferential seating.</p>
