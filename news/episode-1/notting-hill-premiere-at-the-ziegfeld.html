<p>Tonight there is a premiere for Notting Hill at the Ziegfeld so we'll be offline for a few hours. We had to move "Echo Base" (the van) to make room for the limos. Hopefully there will be celebrity sightings on the line tonight. We'll be armed with a digital camera, so expect pictures tomorrow.</p>

<p>And yes...this means the webcam is down tonight too. Sorry :(.</p>
