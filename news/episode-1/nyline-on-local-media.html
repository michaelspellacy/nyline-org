	<p>Television crews descended on the NYLine for a second day in a row, with coverage planned for several of the local network affiliates during their 10 and 11 p.m. newscasts.</p>

	<p>WNBC-4, Fox 5, WABC-7 and UPN-9 all dispatched reporters to the NYLine, with packages expected to air during this evening's newscasts. E! Entertainment Television, the New York Post, the Village Voice and the New York Daily News also had reporters on-hand covering all the day's festivities.</p>

	<p>Rumors surfaced that an NBC-TV affiliate in Michagan had run a story on the NYLine, and an interview featuring line member (and web guru) Matt Simantov aired on an Atlanta, GA radio station.</p>

	<p>In addition, the line had its first international "visitors" at 3:45 p.m. EDT, when John, Jeanette, Max, Sam, Rob, Jasper, Alex and John rang the pay telly outside the Ziegfeld. PR Princess Suzanne Sousa took the call from the UK fans, who plan to join the line in time for opening weekend.</p>
