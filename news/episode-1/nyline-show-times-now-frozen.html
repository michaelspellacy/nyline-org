	<p>Unless you have already emailed to request otherwise, all confirmed NYLine members will be attending the May 19 12:01 a.m. screening at the Ziegfeld Theater.</p>

	<p>NYLine Administrator Michele Hadlow said email requests for the prime time show received by Friday have been processed, and those members will have tickets for the evening show May 19. The exact show time for that screening will be posted as soon as the Ziegfeld sets its schedule.</p>

	<p>As the NYLine has been allotted a fixed number of tickets for each screening, we cannot process any future requests to change show times.</p>
