	<p>In the nastiest bit of New York weather to hit since the line started, a brief but potent squall sent NYLine members diving for cover.</p>

	<p>The rainy conditions have hindered fundraising efforts for the Starlight Children's Foundation, as contributions today are significantly lower than those last Saturday.</p>

	<p>Local forecasts predict warmer, drier weather for the coming week. As conditions improve, please urge your family, friends, and coworkers to drop by the Ziegfeld Theater, 54th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, to show their support for Starlight.</p>
