	<p>The past few days have seen their fair share of chaos, with the gigantic line around the Ziegfeld and the premiere if the new Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant film "Notting Hill."</p>

	<p>Once things calm down, though, the NYLine will resume business as usual.</p>

	<p>Because we now have tickets and could stay at home until Tuesday night, our presence at the Ziegfeld will focus attention on our dedication to raise awareness and funds for the Starlight Children's Foundation.</p>

	<p>We would like to remind people to show up for their scheduled shifts, and if you have already fulfilled the minimum number of shifts to earn tickets, we would ask that you sign up for as many additional shifts as your schedule can accommodate. Also, please remember to show up for all your assigned shifts. If you miss two without presenting a valid excuse, you forfeit your ticket to the Wednesday show and we will donate your ticket money to Starlight.</p>

	<p>This weekend promises to be the most exciting yet, with a Star Wars memorabilia auction (including the "Droids" animation cell seen here), another installment of the Star Wars Dating Game, Star Wars Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit tournaments, and the Yomega Yo-Yo Showdown. We are also expecting visits from the media; let's try to show them (and their viewers) what we're willing to do for the Starlight Kids!</p>
