<p>The wait is finally over. Tickets for "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" went on sale at 3 p.m. Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sources at the Ziegfeld Theatre said approximately 100 people had purchased tickets on the first hour at the box office. When advance sales began, the line for the Ziegfeld reached all the way down 54th Street, up Sixth Avenue, and back around 55th Street to Seventh Avenue.</p>

<p>By 4:15 p.m., the Moviefone service for the Ziegfeld had crashed, much to the frustration of ticket buyers who redialed continuously during the previous hour. A lucky few did manage to order tickets through Moviefone before the service went down.</p>

<p>Show times at the Ziegfeld are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>9:45 AM., 1:15 PM, 4:45 PM, 8:15 PM, 12:00 AM, and 3:30 AM</strong></p>
