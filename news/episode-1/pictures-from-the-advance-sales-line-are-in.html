title: Pictures From The Advance Sales Line Are In!
theme: episode-1

	<p>The line this afternoon was unreal...going all the way around the block, with an estimated 1500 people waiting in line to get tickets.</p>

	<p>There were even more people coming in in the afternoon, when news arrived that Moviefone had literally crashed and the only way to get tickets was to line up!</p>

	<p>We shot about a hundred pictures of the line festivities, so there is a pretty good chance you'll recognize yourself in some pictures ;-)</p>

	<p>Oh and by the way, check out the last 2 pictures from the FOX NEWS scrolling banner on the corner of 50th street! Really cool!</p>
