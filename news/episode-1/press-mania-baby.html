	<p>Two days and counting...</p>

	<h2>Pre-Coverage</h2>

	<blockquote>

		"...a fan-powered group called NYLine Countdown is hosting what I guess should be called a 'stand-in' to benefit the Starlight Children's Foundation. It seems that legions of Star Wars fans citywide will be standing in line from today until the movie's release on May 19th. They'll be standing in shifts (presumably running home periodically to surf the net and dust their Boba Fett figurines) and racking up money via sponsors for each hour they stand in line..."

	<blockquote>

		"Fans are lining up now for the big flick and turning it into a charity event by raising money for the Starlight Children's Foundation. May the Force be with them..."

	<blockquote>

		"Since there will be advanced tickets for Episode I, you guys are not lining up anymore, right?"
