<p>After a slow, damp start this morning, a break in the weather brought sunnier spirits and warmer temperatures to the NYLine. With them came an abundance of passers-by, who had a front-row seat for the taping of NYLine's own soap Opera, "Life Line."</p>

<p>Line coordinator Robert Cartegena served as director of the first episode. His experience as coordinator allowed him to do the impossible - when he yelled "Quiet on the set!" on a crowded Midtown street, people actually became silent.</p>

<p>This original continuing drama will unfold over seven to 10 episodes on NYLine TV, and it tells of the passions and deceptions that erupt among a group of twenty-something fans while waiting on line for a certain movie to premiere.</p>

<p>Fiction and reality merged when the shooting of "Life Line" overlapped with the arrival of a news crew from the BBC. The crew stayed on-hand to capture the late afternoon and early evening events which included a high stakes Yomega Yo-Yo contest and a cutthroat trivia competition.</p>
