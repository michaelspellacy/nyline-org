	<p>So far nearly <strong>$3,300</strong> has been raised for Starlight. This includes money from pledges, the auction, concession stands, and strangers on the street!</p>

	<p>The race is on for the top fundraiser. Right now, $1,315 in pledge money has been turned in. The front runner is Suzanne Sousa with $500 in pledges, followed by Robert Culver at $230 and Dave Creighton with $200.</p>

	<p>Thanks also to Michele Hadlow, Steve Lubot, Jewels Sem, Joe Zurlo, and Eric Sanchez for their collections.</p>

	<p>Starlight is looking forward to receiving many more pledges from NYLiners. Prizes will be awarded to the top fundraisers, with a very special prize for the top overall fundraiser of all the lines. Who will it be? Is the force with you?</p>

	<p>Pledges can be sent to Michaela Potter at:</p>

	<p><strong>Starlight Children's Foundation NY-NJ-CT<br>1560 Broadway<br>Suite 600<br>New York, NY 10036</strong></p>
