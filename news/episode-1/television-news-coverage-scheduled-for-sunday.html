<p>ABC and NBC will be vying for the NYLine's attention as crews from ABC-7 and "Sunday Today" visit the line Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Any line members in metro area are urged to show up at the Ziegfeld theatre by 7:30 a.m. This is an excellent opportunity to raise awareness for the Starlight Children's Foundation, and our presence will be more impressive if we have a visible crowd gathered.</p>

<p>If you can't make it to the Ziegfeld, be sure to set your VCRs. ABC-7 will be broadcasting from the line during its weather segments throughout the morning. Check your local listings for NBC's "Sunday Today".</p>
