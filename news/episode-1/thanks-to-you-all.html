	<p>I would like to thank everyone who made the evening of May 7th such a memorable experience. Not even in my wildest dreams did I think my birthday would be so amazing.</p>

	<p>As I arrived at the Ziegfeld after work, my beloved NYLine fans were holding vigil in the pouring rain. Eventually, a group of us traveled downtown to the Voila.com party at The Void. The Southern Comfort started flowing and it did my heart well to be among friends. It was the first chance for many of the NYLine organizers and the Voila team to relax after weeks of intense work! I felt edgy around 11:00 pm cause I wanted, needed to be back at the LINE to turn 27 at 12:01 am!</p>

	<p>Imagine my surprise when I exited the cab, to see a huge crowd and a stormtrooper clearing a path to a make-shift throne! I was given wonderful presents wrapped in Star Wars finery. And the cake, my Jedi, the cake was truly breathtaking! It was a huge cake with a Darth Maul figurine and an awesome graphic of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul in a lightsaber battle - Jewels, I do not know how you did it, but I will be forever grateful.</p>

	<p>Thank you Lynn, Robert, Michele, Louis, Karen, Noel, Abbas, Amit, Jewels, Gio, Vincent, Mike, Spell, the two Jasons, John, Steve, Michela, Ariel, Alex, Julie and all the NYLine Star Wars fans for making my 27th birthday one for the record books. It was only fitting that before I went to sleep Saturday night, I glanced at my desk calendar for the quote of the day and I dedicate the following words to the NYLine...</p>
