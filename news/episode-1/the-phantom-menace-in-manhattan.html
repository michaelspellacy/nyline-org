<p>FYI, The Phantom Menace will only play in 6 theaters in Manhattan, including of course the Ziegfeld, and the Clearview First & 62nd St. Cinema, United Artists' Union Square 14, the Olympia Twin on 103rd St. and Broadway, the Murray Hill and the newly refurbished 86th Street.</p>

<p>Loews will not play the picture on any of its screens in Manhattan, since they didn't manage to reach an agreement on rental terms with Fox.</p>
