	<p>Well after a long and arduous morning we finally have the NYLine Tickets. It was grueling but Suzanne Sousa managed to secure all the tickets we requested.</p>

	<p>Not only did we get the tickets but we were first in line to buy any others we needed for all our friends and family. Thank you Frank Parisi and Clearview Cinemas.</p>

	<p>Suzanne Sousa and Giovanni Jaramillo were officially the first two people to get tickets and boy the media all over them. Interviews with every major newspaper, television station and affiliates and Radio station were given by these who hardworking and loyal NYLiners.</p>

	<p>I am proud to say there were no altercations and everything was handled very smoothly.</p>

	<p>BOY, I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE 19TH!!!</p>

	<p>Stay tuned for exclusive footage on NYLine TV and photos in the Voila Photo Gallery.</p>

	<p>Thanks to all who made this possible.</p>

	<p>I feel like a proud papa!!!</p>
