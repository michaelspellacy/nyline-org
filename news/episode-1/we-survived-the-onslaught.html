<p>After hundreds and hundreds of people on the line last night to purchase tickets mostly everyone was served. The management of Clearview Cinemas were completely overwhelmed by the hordes of fan-crazed individuals.</p>

<p>The last people were served around 4:00 a.m. who were very happy to get tickets. Security was on hand all night to keep the fans in order. It was definitely a sight to see.</p>

<p>The NYLine will be in front of the Ziegfeld until the 19th, raising money and awareness for the Starlight Children's foundation.</p>

<p>We also have a lot of cool prizes and games coming up this final weekend &mdash; including the auctioning of an original cell from the animated series "Droids", complete with certificate of authenticity.</p>

<p><em>So come on down all you NYLiners - it's going to be a blast!</em></p>
