	<p>The management for the Ziegfeld Theater will be meeting Monday afternoon to determine the theater's advance ticket sales policy.</p>

	<p>Once the Ziegfeld's policy is ironed out, the NYLine will post a copy.</p>

	<p>Regardless of the Ziegfeld's policy, NYLine members should remember to show respect and extend courtesy to everybody who shows up at the Ziegfeld for "The Phantom Menace." However, because of insurance caps, people not signed up with the NYLine will be unable to participate in any official NYLine events.</p>
