	<p>Now that you have your ticket (or if you don't have your tickets yet but need help choosing the best section on Moviefone), here's the <a href="/docs/episode-1-seating-chart.jpg">seating chart of the Ziegfeld theater</a>.</p>

	<p>The screen is <em>really</em> wide, therefore all seats have a pretty good view of the screen. Also, on the balcony, eyes are level with the screen!</p>

	<p>A big thanks to the Ziegfeld managment for this seating chart.</p>
