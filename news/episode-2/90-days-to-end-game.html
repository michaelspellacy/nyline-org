	<p>Wow! Only 90 more days to go! Three months! Woo-hoo! I just wanted to let you all know that (as if you didn't already know) and also wanted to inform you all that talks with the Ziegfeld will be getting underway very, very shortly. The ball is rolling now!</p> 

	<p>Stay tuned to NYLine.org for more updates and news on <strong>the</strong> line up of 2002!</p>
