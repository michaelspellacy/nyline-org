	<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020123122350/http://bigapplecon.com:80/">Big Apple Conventions</a>, in association with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080907062448/http://www.swnyc.com/">Star Wars NYC</a>, will be hosting another Celebrity Charity Dinner! Our guests will be Peter and Angie Mayhew, with possibly others to be announced.</p>

	<p>The dinner will be held on Saturday, Nov. 10th at 8:00 pm at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010405000846/http://www.mars2112.com/">Mars 2112</a>. The restaurant is at Broadway and 51st Street, down the stairs from the Paramount Building courtyard. A $10.00 donation to the Brooklyn Museum of Art will be requested of attendees; more information about our charity can be seen here.</p>

	<p>Our dinner with Jeremy Bulloch was a great success. We raised $150.00 for the Brooklyn Museum of Art, which will help pay for bringing sick and/or less fortunate kids to see the upcoming Magic of the Myth exhibit. The Force is with us!</p>

	<p>Please email your RSVPs to StarWars NYC</p>

	<p><strong>You absolutely MUST RSVP if you wish to join us. Please note that our guests will NOT be signing autographs at dinner. Autograph seekers will be gently escorted away from the dinner table by a Stormtrooper.</strong></p>

	<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
