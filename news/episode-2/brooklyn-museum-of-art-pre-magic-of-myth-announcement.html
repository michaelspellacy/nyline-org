	<p>Greetings lovers of everything Star Wars:</p> 

	<p>The Brooklyn Museum is proud to announce that C3PO and R2D2 will be on display in the lobby of the Brooklyn Museum of Art starting January 30th, 2002 to attract the attention of those attending the Museum that don't know about the MOM exhibit.</p> 

	<p>A great opportunity to view our favorite Droids would be during the BMA's First Saturday events, February 2nd, 2002.</p>

	<p>Admission to the museum for these events is free.</p>

	<p>For more information on the First Saturday events at the BMA, please check out their web page: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030207031730/http://brooklynmuseum.org:80/programs/first_saturday.html">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/programs/first_saturday.html</a></p> 

	<p>The Empire City Garrison will be attending to make sure no rebels try to steal the Droids.</p>
