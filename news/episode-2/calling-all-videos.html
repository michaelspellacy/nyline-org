	<p>NYLine is attempting to put together a master tape of all news coverage and unusual video footage members may have taken during the 1999 and 2002 Ziegfeld lines.</p>

	<p>If you happened to record local or national news coverage, or if you documented your personal experiences on video, please submit a copy to:</p>

	<p>David Vining/NYLine Media<br>c/o Alan's Alley Video<br>207A 9th Avenue<br>New York, NY 10011</p>

	<p>If you are in the neighborhood and would like to drop the tapes off, Alan's Alley is between 22nd and 23rd Street.</p>

	<p>To have your tapes returned, be sure to enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope. Also, to simplify the process, please label each tape with the type of coverage, whether it's from 1999 or 2002, the date of broadcast and the name of the media outlet. If the tape has only one clip, please have that clip cued up. This may take some time depending on the response and the different video coverage received, so if you are going to need the tape returned in the near future, please send a copy.</p>

	<p>We do already have several copies of the Triumph skit from "Late Night with Conan O'Brien," as well as some of the coverage from ticket day and opening night. If your coverage is from these days, please email <a href="mailto:steve@nyline.org">steve@nyline.org</a>, and we'll let you know whether we already have that coverage.</p>

	<p>Your efforts will help us to put together a media kit for NYLine III in 2005, which we will use to get coverage and sponsors to make the final NYLine the best and most memorable of them all!</p>
