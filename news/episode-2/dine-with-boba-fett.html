	<p>SWNYC Event Organizer, MysterySith, chimes in with this great news...</p>

	<p>Star Wars New York City is pleased to announce its association with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020123122350/http://bigapplecon.com:80/">Big Apple Comic Con</a>. In the past, the founders of SWNYC have attended Big Apple Comic Con on a regular basis along with members of the Empire City Garrison, the New York Area's premier Star Wars costuming group. Big Apple Comic Con is the best comic and toy show in the area always delivering a wide selection of dealers, great stars from the entertainment world, a convenient location and giveaways at a very affordable price. I can attest from personal experience Big Apple Comic Con is a real New York bargain!</p>

	<p>As a way to kick off this relationship with a bang, Big Apple Con has made it possible to re-schedule our dinner with Jeremy Bulloch for Friday night, October 12th at 9pm. We thank Mike for his help and hope all members are able to attend and bring friends and family. A donation of $10.00 per adult will go to Children's Charities and each adult may bring one child at no cost. Dinner at Mars2112 is A La Carte. Please understand that Mr. Bulloch will be signing autographs ONLY at Big Apple Comic Con.</p>
