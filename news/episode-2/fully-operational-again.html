<p>My Goodness! It certainly has been a while! How was everybody's winter? I hope you have all rested up from multiple viewings of AOTC!</p> 

<p>Anyway, just wanted to let you all know that we are FINALLY able to update again. There were some technical problems that I have not had time to fix - thankfully everything is okay now.</p>

<p>It's nice to be back. Can you believe it's been a year?</p>   

<p>While I was messing around on the server I found some pages dating back to our original site from the 1999 line, not all of the links work, but it filled me with such nostaligia I thought I would share it with all of you.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p> 

<p>Why it was a year ago today that we first lined up for Episode II?!? My how the time does fly!</p>
