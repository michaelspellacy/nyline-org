	<p>On behalf of all of us here at the NYLine, I just wanted to wish all of you out there a great holiday season and a happy and healthy New Year.</p> 

	<p>(Well, I didn't actually talk to everyone, but I'm assuming that we all feel that way, or at least that nobody wishes any specific harm to anyone) I'm sure that I'm not the only one looking forward to moving on to 2002, for many reasons...</p> 

	<p>Here's where the fun begins! Stay tuned for a lot more updates as we get the coordinates from the navi-computer to get to May 16th.</p>

	<p>If you haven't done so already, how about making one of your New Years resolutions to sign up for the very-near-publication newsletter? It'll probably be one of the easier ones to accomplish!!</p>
