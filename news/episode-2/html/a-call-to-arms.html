<p>I'm sure some of you out there are starting to get excited as Episode II draws near. I know I am.</p>

<p>At the moment we are shooting for an April 27th start date. Final negotiations are underway and we hope to have an official announcement within the next few days. When that happens, all of you will be able to sign up for shifts here at nyline.org.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we are still feverishly looking for sponsors. If any of you out there know of any companies or organizations who would like to sponsor the NYLine in any capacity, please drop us a line at <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact@nyline.org</a> as soon as possible. We are especially in need of a laptop to update our site from the line, an on-site server to plug our webcam into, and of course...an internet connection to bring it all together.</p> 

<p>While you are all waiting, browse on over to our <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight</a> section and read up on the main reason we nutty Star Wars fans are lining up this time around.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!</p>
