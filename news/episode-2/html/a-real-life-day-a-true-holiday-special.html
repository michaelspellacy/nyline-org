<p>Riddle me this: What can you get a Spell for Christmas (when he already owns a comb)? How's about a beautiful bouncing brand new baby boy? That's right, folks, on the evening of the 25th, our own webMASTER Mike Spellacy became the proud father of little Samuel Michael. The Christmas delivery is powerful for many reasons, a lesser one being the fact that the news of Madame Spell's pregnancy broke during our little soiree on 54th Street in May, tying yet another child to the archives of NYLine history (and proving once more that our kind is capable of procreation). For fear of booming the gasser, and crashing the boss' website again, I'll just link to Spell's (what else) website which features some fantastic pictures of Dad, Mom, and little padawan.

<p>And so, with that good news I, and the rest of the NYLine Staff, want to wish you all the best of holiday seasons. It's hard to believe that it has already been a year since I signed off for 2001, visions of sugarclones dancing in my head. But I suppose any trouble I have in believing would be the reason for why I would fail. Or something. I just have to get used to writing "2003" on my checks. Oh, wait, I don't have anything of value, so that won't be a problem. Still though, I'd like to take the time to think of all the goodness of the past 365 - we've had some weddings and some births in the family, in addition to running into some old friends, and making a whole slew of new ones back in that crazy month of May. So as we look to the future, and to the horizon, we can only hope that this is the start of peace and prosperity in the republic, and that when we meet again we'll all be as happy as we've been in a longo time.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays!!!!</p>
