<p>Well I know that we've been saying this for a while, but this time we mean it! Please sign up for the Newsletter, it is going to be on it's way VERY shortly.</p>

<p>Just a brief status report:</p> 

<p>Things are starting to move, with meetings underway and many important administrative matters to deal with right now. It's the type of stuff that I really shouldn't be mucking up with my Jar-Jar-esque bumbling, but what can I say, I owe most of the staff a life debt in some way, so I'm going to hang around. Perhaps if Matt is reading this, he can post a picture or two!</p> 

<p>And don't forget about that <a href="/newsletter/">Newsletter</a>!</p>
