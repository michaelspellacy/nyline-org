<p>On behalf of the NYLine staff, I would like to <strong>Thank All of You</strong> for being a critical and loyal part of the NYLine II at the Ziegfeld. It was an incredible experience sharing the craziness with everyone and I know everyone misses the wind and rain and 90-minutes of sunshine on the 54th Street pavement. ;+)</p>

<p>Special Thanks goes out to Rob and Victor for going way beyond the call of Jedi duty by devoting so much time and energy to making sure the Line ran smoothly, with no major HyperDrive problems!</p>

<p>For those of you who submitted $50 or more of Starlight donations but didn't get a chance to collect the exclusive NYLine t-shirt <strong>OR</strong> would still like to donate $50 or more to get the t-shirt, please e-mail Michele Hadlow at <a href="mailto:mhadlow@nyline.org">mhadlow@nyline.org</a>. Please continue to visit the site regularly for updates and news about our one-month reunion, "Fan Day" at the Ziegfeld.</p>

<p>In closing, I would like to leave you a quote from our beloved Mace Windu, Samuel L. Jackson, in responses to critics and doubters:</p>

<p>"Star Wars is still very special, and it will always have a place in history. Just because we've grown up and see it through the eyes of adults now doesn't mean it's lost its magic. Maybe we have."</p>

<p><em>May the Force Be with You Always.</em></p>
