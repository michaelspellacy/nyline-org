<h2>NYLine Registration Now Closed</h2>

<p>As noted in earlier news reports, we now have our tickets from the Ziegfeld, and the rest of the 12:01 a.m. screening on May 15/16 is sold out. Because of this, registration for the NYLine is now closed to any additional members.</p>

<h2>An Important Reminder</h2>

<p>As stated in the <a href="/docs/episode-2-line-rules.html">official NYLine rules</a>, if you are scheduled for a shift and fail to show up or sign in, not only do you not get credit for that shift, but you <strong>LOSE the point value of that shift</strong> from your total. Several people have not shown up for their scheduled shifts and risk losing their ticket to the premiere. If you need to make up points, several shifts over the next few days desperately need additional members; see <b>An Extra Serving of Time on the Line</b> for more information.</p>

<h2>Ticket Distribution</h2>

<p>Ticket distribution will begin Sunday May 12 at 3 p.m. <a href="/docs/ziegfeld-seating-chart.html">Priority seating</a> will be given to people with the most points accumulated by the end of Shift 63 (5/12, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.). Shifts 64 - 77 will continue to count toward the prizes that will be awarded at the premiere.</p>
