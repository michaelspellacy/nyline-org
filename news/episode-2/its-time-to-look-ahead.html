<p>It's time to stand in line once again to share a unique experience with old friends, new friends, and total strangers...</p>

<p>Before we get too excited we have lots of planning to do. We had amazing luck the first time around with sponsors, for the line to be more successful, for the fans, and for the Starlight Childrens Foundation, we need to do even better! If you are interested in sponsoring any aspect of the line please <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">email us</a>.</p>

<p>This is it, request those vacation days from work, and get in line!</p>
