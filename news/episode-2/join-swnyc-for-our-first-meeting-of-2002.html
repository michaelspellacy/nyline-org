<p>This is a food court adjacent to a movie theater so there is a good chance we may catch a flick afterwards. Although RS! VPs are not required for this it would be nice to get a good idea of how many of you will be coming. Please E-mail <a href="mailto:starwarsnyc@yahoo.com?subject=Jan 12th Meeting">StarWarsNYC</a> and let us know.</p>

<p>Join the discussion at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030112093748/http://boards.theforce.net/board.asp?brd=10103">SWNYC Forum</a></p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
