	<p>That's right folks, after running a lot of wire and getting our hands sticky on a lot of tape, NYLine is now live! Be sure to visit the site as often as possible as we will be updating several times a day! Hooray!</p> 

	<p>Special thanks go out to Verizon, Dave, and Amit...and who can forget Mark Harvey who kept vigil of the sidewalk so no passerbys would trip over our wiring.</p>

	<p>Be sure to read the important update posted earlier regarding the line up schedule and registration, which can be found by <a href="important-nyline-news-update-everybody-read.html">clicking here</a>.</p>

	<p>Only 11 days to go! Yipee!</p>
