<p>I'm the guy who packed up and carted home most of the stuff that was left behind when we entered the theater for the premiere.

<p>If you left a chair or sleeping bag or blanket that you want back, email me at <a href="mailto:dave@nyline.org">dave@nyline.org</a> and I'll see if it is in my "collection". If you left something that served it's purpose during the last three weeks, please let me know anyway so I know what I can dispose of.</p>

<p>I didn't fit everything in my car, so I can't guarantee that I've got something you forgot there, but I do have a pretty hefty pile of stuff, so let me know.</p>

<p>See you in 2005.</p>
