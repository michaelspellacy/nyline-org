	<p>Did you know that as an NYLine member you are entitled to a 10 percent discount on all "Star Wars" related merchandise (except video games) at Forbidden Planet?</p>

	<p>It's true! Just run down to Forbidden Planet (13th Street & Broadway), stock up on "Star Wars" toys, comics, cards and books, then flash your NYLine JediMasterCard (badge) at the register. No chance cubes, no haggling with Watto - it's the best deal this side of Mos Espa! Just be sure to thank the employees at Forbidden Planet for being such strong supporters of the NYLine for Episodes I and II.</p>

	<p>This offer is open to all registered NYLine members and is good through May 16, 2002.</p>
