<p>...and to all a...why...hello there!</p>

<p>Well, this makes aproximately <strong>two</strong> posts this year. I suppose that is better than the posts we had between 12/1999 and 5/2001. Zero. While the NYLine staff or rebels have disbanded, things in the land of Jedis and Sith are slowly beginning to heat up again. Yes, 2004 looks to be shaping up to be a great year. NYLine meetings, a new website, Clone War cartoons...and best of all, if history has taught us anything, a name for Episode 3 and, oh yes, trailers! Only 518 days to go! May 2005 will be here in no time. <(-_-)></p>
