<h2>Line Etiquette 101</h2>

<p>When you are on the "Line" in front of the Ziegfeld, please do not lean against or put your bags near the Alliance Capitol Building. The property owners, Fisher Bros., whose property we are standing, sitting, sleeping on, do not want any of us near the building. Security can see the Line from the camera atop the Ziegfeld, so please stay within the NYLine border marked in red tape on the sidewalk. We know that it's been like Dagobah on the Line recently with all the rain and wind, but we need to be considerate of Fisher Bros. since they gave us permission to do the Line to begin with.</p> 

<p>Also, if you have trash, please put it in the trash receptacle across the street at the Hilton Hotel. The last thing we want is the Line to look like the trash compactor on the first Death Star. We hope to have a garbage bin at the Line by the end of this week.</p>

<h2>An Extra Serving of Time on the Line</h2>

<p>The following shifts have fewer than 5 participants signed up so far. If you sign up for these shifts, you will get <strong>20 extra points</strong> for each shift. The more points you have, the better your chances for getting prizes to be given out on the night of the first screening and preferential seating. If you're interested, contact the NYLine staff at <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact@nyline.org</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Monday May 6th - 1am - 8 am 30 + 20 extra points = 50</li>
