<p>Well the day of days has finally arrived! The press is here and, as usual, we can't seem to win out with the weather. It's a windy day here at Echo Base 2, but our spirts and our excitment are very high.</p>

<p>In just a few short hours we will begin dismanteling our home here and begin the final wait to enter the theater.</p> 

<p>The theater marquee will also be changed shortly. An event we are all looking forward to!</p> 

<p>Ahhhh...only 11 more hours! Don't forget to bring your badges and to be here at 8PM. NYLine goes in at 9PM, so if you are late - you take your chances with the general public!</p>

<p>Gotta go now! The Conan O'Brien Show is here! What fun!</p>
