	<p>From <em>Star Wars Insider</em>, Issue 61, page 14:</p>

	<blockquote>
		
		<p>"Up north in New York, the NYLine was stationed dutifully outside the Ziegfeld Theater in midtown Manhattan, working to raise money for the Starlight Children's Foundation through donations. The line, which was so organized that people had to sign up to take part in it, had Star Wars Weakest Link, among other things, and generally had a great time. Apparently, Conan O'Brien was so impressed by the line that he sent his cameras over there to harass eager fans."</p>

	<p>Other lines profiled in the article include Chicago, Nashville and Seattle, with photos from San Jose and Los Angeles.</p>
