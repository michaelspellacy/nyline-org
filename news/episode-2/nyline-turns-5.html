	<p>Our favorite PR Princess, Suzanne Sousa, reminds us all that the NYLine celebrated it's fifth birthday on Tuesday, January 27th: 

	<blockquote>

		<p>Another decade, Another cold night.</p>

		<p>The first NYLine meeting was the meeting of legend, greater than any of the five boroughs or Jersey. No need to note where it was (Virgin Megastore Union Square) or when it came (January 27, 1999, 7pm), only to know that...it was the NYLine.</p> 

	</blockquote>	

	<p>You hardcore SW fans should understand the reference to the Star Wars novelization:</p> 

	<blockquote cite="Geroge Lucas, Star Wars Novelization">

		<p>Another galaxy, another time.</p>

		<p>The Old Republic was the Republic of legend, greater than distance or time. No need to note where it was or whence it came, only to know that...it was the Republic.</p>

		<p>Star Wars, From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker</p>

		<p><cite>George Lucas, 1976</cite></p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>Happy 5th Birthday, NYLine!</p>
