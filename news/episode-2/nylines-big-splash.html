	<p>Hello, Gang! Sorry for the long delay between posts - as you know things have been quite hectic here in New York. I think it is safe to say however that NYLine is finally back on track!</p> 

	<p>If you came in from the hompage (or if you look up above at our header) you may have noticed quite a different look.</p>

	<p>This new feel was designed by a our good friend, Tony Jessup - a hell of a great designer if I do say so myself. Check out his site if you like at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020120200415/http://www.tjdesign.com:80/">www.tjdesign.com</a>.</p>

	<p>We actually have two <a href="img/big_splash_page.jpg">homepages</a> (or splash pages as they are commonly known) that load at random upon entry. Go back and hit refresh a few times to see what I mean.</p>

	<p>For all of you who have signed up for the newsletter, please rest assured that it is on the way.</p>
