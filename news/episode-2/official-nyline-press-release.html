	<p><strong>NEW YORK LINE FOR STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES, APRIL 27TH TO MAY 16TH AT THE ZIEGFELD THEATER</strong></p> 

	<p><strong>LINE-A-THON WILL BENEFIT THE STARLIGHT CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION</strong></p>

	<p>NYLine has organized a 20-day line-up, beginning on Saturday, April 27th at 11 a.m. at the Ziegfeld Theater for Lucasfilm's release of "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones." "NYLine is gearing up to make the May 2002 release of 'Episode II: - Attack of the Clones' even more memorable and fun for fans and beneficial for the Starlight Children's Foundation," said NYLine Organizer Suzanne C. Sousa.</p>

	<p>NYLine will use the opportunity surrounding the release of "Episode II" to raise money and awareness for the Starlight Children's Foundation. All 350 line participants will have signed up for shifts at www.nyline.org and have been asked to find sponsors who will donate money for every hour they spend on line. NYLine organizers hope to raise enough money to purchase at least five $3,100 Fun Centers for New York City hospitals. A Fun Center is a mobile entertainment unit containing a TV monitor, VCR and Nintendo 64 Game System that rolls up to the bed of a hospitalized child. Hospitals are requesting the units far more quickly than Starlight can supply them.</p>

	<p>"We are thrilled that the organizers of NYLine have chosen Starlight once again to benefit from this event," said Jodi Doherty, Director of Events and Special Projects, Starlight Children's Foundation NY*NJ*CT. "In addition to raising money, NYLine will raise an unprecedented amount of awareness for Starlight, something you can't put a price on." The mission of the Starlight Children's Foundation is to brighten the lives of seriously ill children. Each year, Starlight serves over 200,000 critically, chronically and terminally ill children throughout New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. In addition to granting wishes for sick children, Starlight provides distracting entertainment programs on hospital pediatric wards, funds special projects for hospitalized children and conducts a variety of outpatient activities.</p>

	<p>NYLine Organizer Steve Lorenzo said, "It's a credit to the resilience of New York City that we're even able to hold this event, and we're pleased to be able to bring happiness to Starlight children and show the world, once again, the generosity and spirit of New Yorkers."</p>

	<p>NYLine is an all-volunteer partnership formed to celebrate the release of the prequels to the "Star Wars" saga. NYLine organized in 1999 to coordinate fans in New York City, the tri-state area and around the world to obtain opening day tickets for one of the most eagerly anticipated movies in the history of cinema: "Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace." Through the dedication of members and the generosity of sponsors, NYLine raised $15,000 for Starlight in cash and product donations, and it secured 25 tickets to an opening day screening of "Episode I" for Starlight children and their families.</p>
