	<p>Don't want the digital Summer of "Star Wars" to end just because AOTC is leaving the Ziegfeld? You can make a difference!</p>

	<p>We have it on good authority that the AMC Empire 25 (234 W. 42nd St.) will determine how long AOTC will contiue playing on its DLP screen based on its box office performance this weekend.</p>

	<p>The film is now on screen 14, which is a 400-seat auditorium. If you want to see the film play digitally in NYC beyond July 18, rally your friends, family and random strangers to fill every one of those seats for as many screenings as possible!</p>
