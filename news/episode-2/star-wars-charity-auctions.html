	<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050402062635/http://starwars.com:80/community/news/2001/12/news20011204.html">Lucasfilm</a> was kind enough to donate some wonderful items to eBay's "Auction for America." Included are a Lightsaber used by Ray Park in filming Episode I, a Stormtrooper helmet used in ESB and ROTJ, a Vader helmet signed by the boss man himself and lots of other goodies! My fav is the R2D2 & C3PO model, I love the detail!</p> 

	<p>Check it out and bust out those credit cards! Too bad I'm one broke bloke...</p>
