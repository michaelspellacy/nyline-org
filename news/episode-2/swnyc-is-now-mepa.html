	<p>MEPA? What the heck is MEPA?</p>

	<p>Well my friends, <strong>MEPA</strong> stands for <strong>Mos Eisely Port Authority</strong> (a cool name if I do say so myself) and it is the new name of the Official New York FanForce Chapter.</p>

	<p>SWNYC, LLC is now a private corporation and has no affiliation with Star Wars, TheForce.Net, or LucasFilm. SWNYC now stands for Sci-Fi World New York City.</p> 

	<p>So now you know...and knowing is half the battle - d'oh! I couldn't help myself!</p>

	<p>Their new website can now be found here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040930154011/http://www.swnyc.com:80/~mepa/">http://www.mepa-nyc.com</a></p>

	<p>Hurry! Go Now! Run, Luke! Run!</p>
