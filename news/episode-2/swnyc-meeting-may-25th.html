	<p>The Episode 2 props have arrived at the Brooklyn Museum of Art so SWNYC is planning an outing there this Saturday, May 25th. We are meeting at the museum cafe at 12:30 where we will hold a meeting. Our main topic will be our involvement with The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020523192452/http://www.hudsonvalleyexpo.com/">Hudson Valley Sci-Fi and Collectibles Expo</a> and our food drive!</p>

	<p>After the meeting, we will be viewing the Magic of the Myth Exhibit which has a new group of Episode 2 props. From the museum we will head over to the AMC theater on 42nd Street in NYC to watch the 6:15 PM Digital showing of Attack of the Clones. Afterwards, we will have dinner.</p>

	<p>Costumes are encouraged and we hope to see everyone there!</p>

	<p>May the FORCE be with you!</p>
