	<p>Friends, while surfing ye olde internet today thou hath pleasantly discovered the lair of our old friend, Blackwolf the Dragonmaster, Duke of Talisker and New York City's first and <em>only</em> Unofficial Wizard.</p>

	<p>We first met Blackwolf on NYLine II during what was quite possibly our greatest moment - getting ripped into by <a href="{{site.triumph}}">Triumph the Insult Comic Dog</a>.</p>

	<p>If you haven't visited already, Blackwolf's website can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140525074023/http://www.dragonmasternewyork.webs.com:80/">here</a>.</p>
