	<p>Hello my old Jedi friends!</p>

	<p>Amit here, just checking in to say hi and drop a few updates. Hope all is well in your respective corners of the outer rim territories! On a personal note, I just took my last ever med school exam yesterday, and for the next 6 weeks I'm finally stepping outside and taking a few nice deep breaths. And y'know, it smells alot like Star Wars out here!</p>

	<p>We've had a history with rain - it seems like its patter has been the main background foley sound effect of our history together (do I watch the special features on my Star Wars DVDs too much?). Anyway, because of the forecast tomorrow, the venue of the planned get together on April 23rd will be moved. Coming to the rescue, as always, is the one and only Vince Hardy, who has offered the meeting room of the Travel Inn for an informal commemoration of the start of the line. So if you're free and would like to meet up and greet up, come over to 515 West 42nd Street (between 10th and 11th Avenues in Manhattan) at around 11 AM on Sunday!</p>

	<p>In '00 and '04, a few of us went down to Star Wars Weekends in Orlando and had a fantastic time. In my experience, the only way to make the Happiest Place on Earth (TM) any happier is to have people dressed up as Gamorrean Guards walking around it. Anyway, after much hemming, hawing, and guilting each other, we finally decided to go again this May, so we wanted to spread the word to anyone interested in joining us! On May 19th, we'll be all over MGM studios, soaking in the magic, trying not to spend too much at the Tatooine Traders shop, and taking multiple Star Tours to Endor with Pee-Wee Herman. Having just bought tickets I can say thank the maker for Jet Blue if you're looking for transport to the Florida system. We would be honored if you wou...well, you know.</p>

	<p>Also, just a heads up - the NYLine message board had to be taken down because a former sponsor transferred them to its server without the permission of the NYLine business partners. The individuals responsible are not official representatives of NYLine, regardless of their past involvement with the organization, and unfortunately the NYLine boards will not return. However, many of us still communicate via the Emperor's Star Wars Message Board at <a href="{{site.forum}}">www.starwarsboard.com</a>, so drop by over there!</p>

	<p>Hope to see you all soon, and feel free to just drop a line to catch up - I've been having numerous visions of friends long gone lately!</p>
