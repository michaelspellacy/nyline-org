She and Michele Hadlow, a 35-year-old Forbes magazine photo editor, are manning a booth to promote NYLine.org. On Saturday, club members will begin their vigil outside Manhattan's Ziegfeld Theatre. (And unlike the misinformed fans in Los Angeles, the big apple fans are in line at the right theater.) This is Sousa's first time to a convention. "I've been a <em>Star Wars</em> fan for a long time but you have to go to a convention to see what it's all about."</blockquote>
