	<p>Well it's that time of the month again, and even if its aided by a raspy mechanical chest box, as long as Star Wars is still breathing, we're going to celebrate it! So join us for a casual get together on Fan Day II, Monday July 18, 2005. Even though Imperial troops entered our base at the Ziegfeld, we will regroup for a digital presentation of our beloved space saga at the UA 14 Theater on Broadway and 13th Street for the 7:30 PM show. And if you can meet up with us earlier, at around 6:00, we'll be at:</p>
		
	<p>Cedar Tavern<br>82 University Place<br>(between 11th & 12th)<br>N,R,Q,W,4,5,6,L to Union Sq.</p>
		
	<p>We hope to meet you at the rendezvous point downtown!</p>
		
	<p>In other news, we have a few XL and 2XL <a href="img/incentive_shirt.jpg">NYLine III "Almost There" Liberty Jedi t-shirts</a> remaining. We thought we'd offer them up to line members first - this is your chance to get another shirt so you can control your fear of spilling some Izze on the one you worked so hard to earn. If you have already purchased one, you can get yourself an extra for just $20. If you didn't get a chance to pick one up on the line, we're asking for the same $60 that the rest of the line members needed to raise. Please add $5 if you want the shirt shipped to you. To pay, you can just donate via our paypal link at www.nyline.org/donate (only a credit card is required) by Thursday, July 21. Then email amit@nyline.org with your size and address. If you're around the NY area and want to forego the shipping cost, let me know and I'll try to meet and...take care of you.</p>
		
	<p>And finally, we've received a transmission from our lady (o'lady?) Guenever, the line member of many faces - mostly her royal highness, Queen Amidala. She sends along this message:</p>
		
	<blockquote>
		
		<p>Hey guys, its Guenever (the one with all the amidala costumes), Hope you're all doing well. I'm taking a tv production class, and I'm supposed to make a little 5 min documentary. I was wondering if there was anyone working on a costume now, and wanted to share, or if you really wanted to show off an already finished costume and explain how you made it. If you'd like to help me out, email me at <a href="mailto:Da2187Leia@hotmail.com">Da2187Leia@hotmail.com</a>. I'd film sometime this week.</p>
		
		<p>Thanks, Guen</p>

	<p>So be a line member indeed, and help out a line member in need!</p>
