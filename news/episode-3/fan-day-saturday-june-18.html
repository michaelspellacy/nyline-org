<p>In both 1999 and 2002, the one-month anniversary of the opening of a new "Star Wars" movie was celebrated as "Fan Day" - a chance for NYLine members to get together, hang out on 54th Street (and elsewhere) and take in one more screening at the Ziegfeld.</p>

<p>As we believe in honoring tradition, plans are starting to take shape for a Fan Day event befitting NYLine III. This year's event will take place a day early so as not to conflict with (I'm Your) Father's Day. If you'd like to be a part of the planning process or Fan Day itself, please head over to <a href="{{site.boards}}">this thread</a> on the <a href="{{site.boards}}">NYLine message boards</a>.</p>

<p>See you June 18!</p>
