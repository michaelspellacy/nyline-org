<p>Thanks to everybody who showed up for Fan Day! From the pool party at the Travel Inn to another amazing digital screening at the Ziegfeld, to dinner and spontaneous dancing at the not-so-secret Burger Joint, to drinks at Old Castle, every stop was a memorable event in its own right!</p>

<p>A special thank you to Vince Hardy, who continues to cement his reputation as a combination of Santa Claus and R2-D2, for providing the next best venue to 54th Street for holding a "Star Wars" line party!</p>

<p>If you weren't able to join us, the next big NYLine outing will be the final screening of "Revenge of the Sith" at the Ziegfeld - Tuesday, June 28. It's the end of an era... you won't want to miss it! Be sure to check <a href="{{ site.boards }}">this thread</a> on our <a href="{{ site.boards }}">message boards</a> for all the latest plans.</p>
