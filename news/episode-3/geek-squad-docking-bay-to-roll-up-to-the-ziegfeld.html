<p>From May 11 through May 18, NYLine welcomes a surprise visitor: the <em>Geek Squad Docking Bay</em>, a 40-foot fully operational workstation dedicated to helping fans stay connected to friends, family, and work, of course. The Star Wars-themed workstation includes Internet-enabled laptops and other mobile technology to enable fans to maintain contact with the rest of the galaxy while waiting in line for the release of the final prequel.</p>

<p>The NYLine has played host to hundreds of eager fans lined up in front of the Ziegfeld Theater since April 30, raising money and awareness for the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050429010523/http://www.geeksquad.com/">Geek Squad</a>, the first 24-hour computer support task force and living embodiment of the term "geek," and a sponsor of NYLine, is rewarding selfless fans by giving us the ability to stay connected with our lives and jobs outside the line...</p>
