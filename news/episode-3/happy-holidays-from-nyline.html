	<p>We would like to take a moment to wish you all a very Happy Holiday and joyous New Year!</p>

	<p>Speaking of New Years, 2005 is a "Star Wars Year" which brings us to the final installment of a movie we have all been excitedly waiting for. Leading up to the main event, there will be new trailers, posters, toys, a soundtrack (can't wait for that soundtrack), and of course, a certain sidewalk line up/charity event called NYLine 3!</p>

	<p>If you have been busy for the holidays and are now just visiting us, here are a few things you should know:</p> 

	<ul>
		<li>We will be lining up in front of the Ziegfeld Theater from April 30th to May 19th.</li>
		<li>Our Charity Affiliate is once again the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>.</li>	
		<li>A tentative Line Schedule may be <a href="/docs/episode-3-line-schedule.html">found here</a>, so start planning those days off!</li>
		<li>Registration for the line will begin sometime in March. As always, you will be able to register online.</li>
		<li>We now have our very own message boards!. Head on over to <a href="{{site.boards}}">NYLine Boards</a> and sign up today!</li>
	</ul>	
			
	<p>Stay tuned for more exciting news from NYLine and, uh, try not to drink too much <em>blue</em> eggnog this year. You know how crazy it makes you get.</p>
