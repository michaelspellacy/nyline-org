	<p>Ah sweet youth, I remember it well...walking around town in my bell bottom pants and tie-dyed shirt, sporting that cool George Jefferson hitch in my step as I headed to class...the year was <em>1999</em>, and I was a sophomore in college who had somehow stumbled my way in to the organization process of the line-up for The Phantom Menace. I'm not exactly sure how it all happened, but I think it involved a life debt, lots of falling down, and much pity.</p> 
		
	<p>One of my primary functions during the lead up to that line was using the one talent that I had - my age. I spent time flyering college campuses around the city in an attempt to pad the ranks of our grand army. And wouldn't you know it, we ended up having turnout from all reaches of the outer rim territories, including all of those places I had plastered with our information. You could say that I single handedly created the success that is the New York Line.</p>
		
	<p>That is the farthest thing from the truth, but it is still something that you could say.</p>
		
	<p>But alas it seems that I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. It's time for someone else to learn the ways of the recruit, and that's what this call is for. We're looking for someone attending college in the Metro area to help us get the word out for NYLine III, through flyering campuses or through any other way that can be thought of. If you're interested, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact@nyline.org</a>. Who knows, this time it could be <strong>YOU</strong> saving the day, getting all the credit and taking all the reward!</p>
