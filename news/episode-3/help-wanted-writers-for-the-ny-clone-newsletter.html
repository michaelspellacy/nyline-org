<p>Any talented writers out there? Want to help us spread the news about the upcoming line for Episode III?</p>
	
<p>In the next couple months, we're going to need to get a lot of information to NYLine members on a fairly aggressive timeline. If you're up to the challenge of quickly turning around copy, we want you on board!</p>
	
<p>Please email me (the address is in <a href="{{ site.boards }}">my board profile</a>), and if possible, attach a writing sample.</p>
	
<p>While we can't offer compensation (NYLine's an all-volunteer organization), you will get some professional looking writing samples out of the deal, and you'll be helping out a very worthwhile cause - the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation.</p>
	
<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
