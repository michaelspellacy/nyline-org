title: "How NYLine Works: Where's Your Spot In the Line?"
theme: episode-3
---

	<p>NYLine participants who earn their 60 shift points are guaranteed a ticket for the opening-night screening of "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith." Where you sit once you're inside the Ziegfeld Theatre depends on two numbers &ndash; the shift points you earn during the line, and the amount of money you raise for the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>.</p>

	<p>We will be let into the Ziegfeld about an hour prior to the general public. Between 7 and 9 p.m. on May 18, you will be lined up outside the theater based on your cumulative point total, which will be calculated by adding your accumulated shift points to the number of dollars you raised for Starlight Starbright during the Stand-A-Thon &ndash; one point for each dollar turned in to NYLine by 9 p.m. Tuesday, May 17.</p>

	<p>To check your running point totals once the line starts, use our <a href="/login.html">NYLine Membership Update site</a>. Remember, you do not need to register for all the shifts you plan to attend; after you have earned the 60 points toward your ticket, all you need to do to collect additional shift points is show up at the Ziegfeld and sign in when each new shift begins.</p>

	<p>The top point earner will head the line, with everybody else lined up in descending point order. This is how you will enter the Ziegfeld to select your seat for the premiere &ndash; the NYLine members with the highest totals will get the best seats in the house. If you are an outlander and let us know in advance, your Starlight Starbright donations will count toward priority seating as long as you turn them in by 5 p.m. on May 18.</p>

	<p>In an NYLine first, we will be holding special fundraising shifts during the line itself, identified as "Beggar's Canyon" on the <a href="/docs/episode-3-line-schedule.html">shift schedule</a>. During each Beggar's Canyon shift, a fund-raising goal will be set; if line members raise enough money on <a href="know-thy-pavement.html">54th Street</a> during the shift to meet the goal, everybody signed in for that shift will earn a three-point boost for their shift point total. While three points may not seem like a lot, it may be enough to break ties, especially for members whose ability to raise funds or spend time on the line is limited.</p>

	<p>The best way to ensure a spot at the front of the line is download some <a href="/docs/nyline-3-starlight-pledge-form.pdf">Stand-A-Thon sponsor forms</a>, raise an astronomical amount of money for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050404073240/http://www.starlight-newyork.org/_programs/fun_centers.html">Starlight Starbright's Fun Center Program</a>;and plan to spend as much time with us on 54th Street as your schedule allows. With as many as 350 participants expected for this final installment of NYLine, the competition is bound to be fierce!</p>
