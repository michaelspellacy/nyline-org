<p>What an amazing experience this has been! Last night's premiere far exceeded anything we could have hoped for in our wildest dreams. While all of us had hoped we'd beat our 2002 fund-raising total of $18,000 and we secretly desired to top our combined total of $33,000 from the first two lines, none of us could have possibly foreseen the total that appeared on the check we presented to the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation last night - $46,600!</p>

<p>Thank you so much to every sponsor, the staff of Clearview's Ziegfeld Theatre, the family, friends and co-workers who endured our absence while providing emotional and financial support, and all the generous people who found it in their hearts to assist this wonderfully worthy cause.</p>

<p>But most of all, thanks to all of YOU - the members of NYLine III! Your dedication to both the line and to Starlight Starbright is unparalleled in the history of our organization, and you brought a level of fun and energy to 54th Street that will never be equaled. It's been an honor and a privilege to share the sidewalk and this experience with each and every one of you. Congratulations. Thank you. And may the Force be with you... ALWAYS!</p>
