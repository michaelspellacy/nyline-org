<p>A one man army, the SUPER SUCKLORD has been cranking out hot underground experiments from an undisclosed location in New York City since 1977. The SUCKLORD is synonymous with his evil arts organization known as SUCKADELIC. A further mutation of a man formerly known as the SUPERGENIUS, the SUCKLORD first gained international noteriety with the seminal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050414205729/http://www.suckadelic.com/Starwarsmusic.html">STAR WARS BREAKBEATS</a> CD. Released in 1997, this quirky gem broke the CMJ top 40, was praised in the BEASTIE BOYS' GRAND ROYAL magazine, and was featured on NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED  program.</p>

<p>This release was followed in 2001 by the sleeper album <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416065702/ttp://www.suckadelic.com/LOTRmusic.html">SAURON SPEAKS</a>: Fat Beats from the Dark Tower. More abstract than its predecessor, this LORD of the RINGS remix record may have been too inside for general consumption. It was, however, embraced by many J.R.R. Tolkien fans worldwide. This was the project that lead the SUCKLORD to become a memeber of the Tolkien inspired hip hop group, The LORDS of the RHYMES.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050416065853/http://www.suckadelic.com/SuperVillainsMusic.html">SUPERVILLAINS</a> album for 2005 promises to out-suck any SUCKADELIC record to date. This audio celebration of EVIL and MAYHEM gets deep into all your favorite baddies such as SKELETOR, COBRA COMMANDER, MEGATRON, and GARGAMEL. Don't sleep!</p>

<p>Beyond music, the SUCKLORD is an up and comming artist and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050418180512/http://www.suckadelic.com/ActionFig.html">toy designer</a>. His work has been reviewed in Toyfare magazine and has shown in groundbreaking galleries such as ALIFE, 360 TOY GROUP, and TOY TOKYO. 2004's SUCKLORD 66  bootleg figure continues to baffle even the most avant-garde collectors. A new line of locally produced toy-art collectables from SUCKADELIC will be unleashed in the summer of 2005, so look out!
