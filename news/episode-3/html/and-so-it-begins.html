<p>Well, the first full day of NYLine III is nearly at an end, and what a whirlwind of a day it was!</p>

<p>We arrived at the Ziegfeld and set up camp at 10 o'clock this morning. As usual, the press was there to cover the big event. We were paid visits by 1010 WINS, The Daily News, Eyewitness News, Channel 4 News, Channel 2 News, Fox 5 News, NY1, and probably a dozen more that I cannot remember at the moment.</p>

<p>Also on hand to help the NYLine were the boys in white (and black) from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050404021726/http://www.empirecitygarrison.com/">Empire City Garrison</a>. DJ Funkmaster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050404034552/http://www.suckadelic.com/">Suckadelic</a> was also on site to break out the tunes for our first evening Outlander shift.</p>

<p>Despite the miserable weather, spirits were very high and a good time was had by all staff and members. Star Wars is back! Come join the NYLine, celebrate the love and help us raise money for Starlight by <a href="/register.html">registering here</a>.</p>
