<p>Just got home from Shift 21 and the first hour of our 1st overnight - SHIFT 22!</p>

<p>It's windy, cold, rainy and our stream of tents are skewed at a 72 degree angle. Instead of attempting to write a legible report, I offer instead some quotable quotes...</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shift 22 - 1st overnight...WOO HOO!!</li>
	<li>Is that lightsaber a spoiler?</li>
	<li>Honey, Let's Blow up the Bed.</li>
	<li>The Yankees are so in the Toilet! <em>(followed by loud slapping sounds as Suzanne attacks the Boston fan who shall remain nameless)</em></li>
	<li>The Padawn Picnic has been postponed until next Saturday...(repeated 36 times.)</li>
	<li>What?! No <em>Corvette Summer</em>! I'm out of here!</li>
	<li>Raves for E3 in <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> & <em>Variety</em>!</li>
	<li>Freeks and Geeks Rock!</li>
	<li>Hey AJ! You're not wearing shorts!</li>
	<li>What's your preference - erotica or porn?</li>
</ul>

<p>Good night!</p>
