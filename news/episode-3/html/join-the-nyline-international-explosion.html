<p>Everywhere around the world...they're coming to America!</p>

<p>Over the past several weeks, we've begun to notice that a large percentage of our new NYLine registrants are coming in from all corners of the outer rim territories. And <a href="{{ site.boards }}">this thread</a> on our messageboard made me want to send out an offical welcome to our friends traveling in to experience this last of its kind party, and invite anybody else who's thinking about experiencing the type of Star Wars premiere event that you've seen on the news or heard about from your fellow fans.</p>

<p>The excited hush when the lights go down...the two breaths of anticipation before the logos appear...and the cathartic cheers as you see the words STAR WARS blaze their way across the screen, all experienced with 1200 of your like-minded bretheren. It's...quite the thing to see. And it's an event that takes on so much more meaning after getting to know so many of those around you on the line during the days leading up to opening night, working with them to help raise money for the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>We know that traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, so we waive our minimum requirement of line-waiting for International visitors and decrease the minimum for travelers coming in from outside the tri-state area. Simply making this leap into the unknown proves your dedication to us. And thanks to our friends at Clearview Cinemas, NYLine members' tickets have already been set aside for us so we can focus on fundraising. Thus, joining the NYLine gets you a <strong>guaranteed ticket</strong> to the midnight premiere of Revenge of the Sith at the historic Ziegfeld Theatre in Manhattan.</p>

<p>For anybody on the fence about taking that crazy trip to a faraway place, not knowing anybody, not knowing what to do...trust me. We will help you in every way, you will not be alone, and you will not regret it. This path has been placed before you. The choice is yours alone.</p>

<p>Do what you think you cannot do. <a href="/register.html">Join us</a>!</p>

<p>And for our fellow New Yorkers, if you haven't signed up yet, <a href="/register.html">register now</a>! We know how hard it is to schedule for the future when you're living in the city that never sleeps, but make sure you get on board before the first transport heads away. And help us welcome the world to the greatest city in the galaxy.</p>
