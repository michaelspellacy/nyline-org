<p>This Saturday will mark the one month anniversary of our ROTS opening night festivities and the end of the NYLine. But mourn it do not, and miss it do not because for at least one more day we can commune with each other in celebration of everything we've been able to accomplish, in celebration of Star Wars, and in celebration of the love! We've planned a full day of merriment so that hopefully everyone will at least be able to drop in at some point for a round of hugs and a Lava Berry Explosion Pop Tart or six. Simon has posted a rundown of the events in our messageboard, <a href="{{ site.boards }}">click here</a> to check it out!</p>

<p>Here's a brief summary:</p>

<p>As some of you know, our own Vince Hardy is the administrator of a facility known as the Travel Inn, a hotel right around Times Square. We'll be meeting there at 2:00 PM to catch up and lounge around by the pool, so feel free to bring your swimsuits and A99 aqua breathers! If it's raining we'll hang out in the vast conference room - just like the line, there'll be no stopping us (this, or any time). The hotel is located at:</p>

<p>515 West 42nd Street (between 10th & 11th Avenues) <br>New York, NY 10036</p>

<p>By 6:00, we will probably have made our march (or subway, taxi, bus, sandcrawler) back to our home at the historic Ziegfeld Theatre, to do what we do best &ndash; wait in line for Star Wars. The shift will count for 15 points :P</p>

<p>We'll be seeing the 7:00 PM show of "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith", in case you were wondering.</p>

<p>After the movie, make sure your hair is properly coiffed or feathered for a nice family photo that we want to take at the theater before heading to dinner at the fantastic NYLine III staple, The Burger Joint. If you're meeting us there, it'll probably be around 9:45 PM, and it's located in Le Parker Meridien Hotel at: </p>

<p>118 West 57th Street (between 6th & 7th Avenues) <br>New York, NY 10019 (Hidden in a nook down the hall in front of the big grey curtain on your left).</p>

<p>So that's the plan! We can't wait to run into some old friends this Saturday, it will be a day long...well, you know.</p>
