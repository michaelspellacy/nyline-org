<p>Thanks to the supreme generosity of NYLine members, we all of a sudden have four new auction items that we're putting up for bids in our eBay auction benefiting the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children Foundation</a>! We are going to put up these items as 3 day auctions, which will end with the ongoing third and final batch of items, that are up for bids now.</p>

<p>The first new item is an offical<strong> ILM VFX Crew T-shirt for Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith </strong> (size: Large), donated by dedicated line member Michael Fix. The front of the shirt reads "ILM - VFX Crew" and the back reads "Star Wars - The Circle is now Complete. 1977-2005", and lists the names of all 6 movies (The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi) around the Imperial logo. A limited number of these shirts were only available to ILM Crew. This is a rare and great collectible!</p>

<p>The next items were donated by NYLine staple (in that he's stapled to the line) James Prater. At Celebration III in Indianapolis, he met with <strong>David Prowse and Peter Mayhew</strong>, who <strong>autographed action figures of Darth Vader and Chewbacca</strong>, respectively. Both figures were from the 2002 "Saga" line.</p>

Suckadelic, the super genius behind the world reknown Star Wars Breakbeats CD and custom action figures as well as the famous "Graffiti AT-AT" brings us this amazing <strong>custom diorama of the NYLine</strong> for auction to benefit the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation.</p>
