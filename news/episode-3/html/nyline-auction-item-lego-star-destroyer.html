<p>Look at the size of that thing!!</p>

<p>The <strong>Imperial Star Destroyer</strong> - striking fear in to the hearts of rebel scum since 1977. And now you can have the chance to know what it was like to be an innocent independent contractor, building this massive starship from the ground up. Our good friends and sponsor, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/"><strong>LEGO</strong></a>, have graciously donated this sealed, brand new set from their <strong>Ultimate Collectors Series - Item #10030</strong> for our eBay auction benefiting the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>When the bidding starts on April 21st, you can add the Imperial Navy's best-known and most powerful ship to your LEGO <i>Star Wars</i> collection! Measuring an impressive 37" by 23", this model dwarfs any LEGO <i>Star Wars </i>ship ever produced. This beautifully designed and one-of-a-kind collector's item comes with a special display stand and collectors card. It also includes an exclusive Rebel Blockade Runner Mini-Model, so you can recreate the opening scenes of <i>Star Wars</i> IV: A New Hope!</p>
