<p>The following item up for bids in our eBay auction benefiting the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a> was a late addition to our catalogue. And that should come as no surprise, considering that it was donated by JediRob Martin. I personally think the only reason he won the prize for most time waited on NYLine II was because he knew he'd be late for his shifts, so he never left. But after two lines he is now an NYLine Staff member with a strong dedication to Starlight, which makes him quite possibly the most powerful JediRob ever.</p>
