<p>For the Jedi it is time to eat as well! But I bet that even they never had it this good. Donated by our own Suzanne Sousa to the eBay auction for the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>, these beautiful collector plates will make a fine addition to your china cabinet, and can class up even the most wretched hive of scum and villainy.</p>

<p>This gorgeous set of <strong>four limited edition collectible plates</strong> from the Star Wars Heroes and Villains series was presented exclusively by<strong> The Hamilton Collection</strong> from 1997-2001. You will be bidding on <strong>Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Darth Vader</strong>. The plates are approximately 8 inches in diameter, made of fine porcelain and are rimmed with 24K gold. All four plates have various scenes from the Original Trilogy movies and are painted by sci-fi artist Pete Birdsong. Each plate comes with a Certificate of Authenticity. These plates have been retired for some time and are only available on the secondary market. They make a great addition to any Star Wars fan's collection.</p>
