<p>With just four weeks remaining until the start of NYLine III on April 30, it's time for a quick update.</p>

<p>After two weeks of registration, NYLine is almost halfway to filling its membership ranks, and prime shifts are beginning to close! While you are welcome to spend as much time on the line as you like (and that time counts towards determining your place in line as we enter the Ziegfeld on May 18), you must register for at least 60 points to earn your opening night ticket, and most shifts have a 30-member ceiling. Currently, almost 40 percent of NYLine III registered members are from outside the tri-state area, so shifts during the final days of the line are closing faster than the Death Star's blast doors! If you haven't registered yet, <a href="/register.html">sign up here</a>! If you are from out of town and joining the line is dependent on signing up for a shift that is already closed, email <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact@nyline.org</a> and we'll try to work something out.</p>

<p>Once you have registered, you can use our <a href="/login.html">NYLine Membership Update site</a> to modify your shift schedule until Saturday, April 23. Just make sure to maintain the 60-point minimum, or you won't be able to save your changes. Once the line begins, you'll be able to use this site to monitor your point totals. Remember, only registered members who earn 60 points are guaranteed a ticket to the midnight screening of "Revenge of the Sith." If you have any questions about registration, please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact@nyline.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you have already registered, be sure to download a <a href="/pledge.html">Stand-A-Thon pledge form</a> - it's never too early to start raising money for the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>, and it's the only way to get this <a href="incentive-t-shirts-the-trilogy-is-now-complete.html">exclusive NYLine t-shirt</a>!</p>

<p>Also, things have really started to pick up on our <a href="{{ site.boards }}">message boards</a>. So if you want to start chatting with your fellow line members about what's going to be happening on 54th Street between April 30 and May 19, be sure to head on over!</p>
