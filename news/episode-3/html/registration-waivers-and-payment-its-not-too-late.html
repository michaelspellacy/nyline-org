<p>Even thought the midnight screening at the Ziegfeld sold out last weekend, it's not too late to <a href="/register.html">register for NYLine</a>! We purchased enough tickets to cover 350 members and staff; registration will continue until any remaining tickets are claimed.</p>

<p>If you have registered but still need to mail your waiver, please try to do so in the next couple days. One thing we've learned over the past six years is that the prevalent windy conditions on 54th Street make processing paperwork on the line extremely difficult. We'd like to avoid it at all costs.</p>

<p>Finally, if you were planning to pay with a money order and haven't already sent it, we would <em>strongly</em> encourage you to consider using PayPal. Registered members can access PayPal through the <a href="/login.html">Member Area</a>, which you may also use to see whether we've received your waiver and, once the line begins, to check your running point total and your collected Starlight donations.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help with these matters - see you at the Ziegfeld in SIX days!</p>
