<img alt="Row M.com - The Best Seat in the House" src="img/rowm_logo.gif" align="right" />Row M, an organization devoted to all things fandom and ensuring "the best seat in the house" for fan events in New York City, has now joined our list of growing sponsors for the big line up starting on April 30th!</p>

<p>The name Row M actually refers to a row of seats at the Ziegfeld Theater. It was there, during our 2002 event, that this very cool alliance was born.</p>

<p>We are very proud to have them as a sponsor. Their help is sure to bring an extra level of excitement and fun to the line this year.</p>
