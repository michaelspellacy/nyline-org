<p><!--StartFragment --><SPAN class=q>The top shift point earners and fundraisers also will be awarded prizes opening night. It's not too late to increase your totals and move yourself closer to the front of the line - you have approximately 48 more hours to <a href="/docs/nyline-3-starlight-pledge-form.pdf">collect money from Stand-A-Thon sponsors</a> or to come on down to 54th Street and spend some more time on the line!</p>

<p><SPAN class=q>Be sure to check that we have tallied all of your points correctly by logging into the <a href="/login.html">NYLine Members area</a>. If you feel that there is some discrepancy, email us at <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact@nyline.org</a>.</p>
