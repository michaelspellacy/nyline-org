<p>'Twas the night before Sithmas, when all through the tent</p>

<p>Not a creature was stirring, not even Lauren Kent.</p>

<p>The Starlight banners were hung by the mini-fridge with care,</p>

<p>In the hopes that St. Lucas soon would be there.</p>

<p>The line members were nestled all snug in their bags,</p>

<p>With visions of twi'lek girls dancing in rags.</p>

<p>JediRob in his kerchief, and I in my Max Rebo costume,</p>

<p>Had just settled a debate on which twin would be first from Padme's womb.</p>

<p>When out near the theater there arose such a clatter,</p>

<p>I threw off my Jar-Jar blanket to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>Away towards the bike rack I flew like a mynock,</p>

<p>Peeked into Fisher Park, and trekked down the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The moon on the puddles from the constant falling rain</p>

<p>Gave light to the lunacy of those of us who remained,</p>

<p>When, what to my wondering eyes should I see,</p>

<p>But a miniature skiff and eight tiny eopies.</p>

<p>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,</p>

<p>I knew it was St. Lucas, or at least his pal Rick.</p>

<p>More rapid than the Falcon, his coursers they came,</p>

<p>And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:</p>

<p>"Now Chewie! Now Malla!</p>

<p>Now, Korman and Carney!</p>

<p>On, Carroll! On, Arthur!</p>

<p>On, Itchy and Lumpy!</p>

<p>To the top of the Hilton!</p>

<p>To the top of the bank!</p>

<p>Now dash away! Dash away!</p>

<p>And watch out for Frank!!"</p>

<p>As General Grievous before a hard battle to face,</p>

<p>When met with the obstacle, jumps into space</p>

<p>So up to the tent-top the coursers they flew,</p>

<p>With the skiff full of Star Wars, and St. Lucas too.</p>

<p>I heard on the roof a landing tough to surpass,</p>

<p>Eopies prancing and pawning, with just a smdigen of gas.</p>

<p>As I drew in my head and was turning around,</p>

<p>Out of the microwave St. Lucas came with a bound.</p>

<p>He was dressed all in flannel, from his head to his feet,</p>

<p>And his clothes were all tarnished with concept art sheets.</p>

<p>A bundle of Star Wars he had flung on his back,</p>

<p>And he looked like Yoda just opening Luke's pack.</p>

<p>His eyes &mdash; how they twinkled! His dimples couldn't be cuter!</p>

<p>His cheeks were like roses, as if made in a computer!</p>

<p>A droll little smile had drawn up both his lips,</p>

<p>And the beard on his chin was as silver as Naboo starships.</p>

<p>The hilt of a lightsaber he held tight from beneath,</p>

<p>And the glow it encircled his head like a wreath.</p>

<p>He had a little round belly which he couldn't contain,</p>

<p>That shook when he laughed, like a bowl of chilled monkey brain.</p>

<p>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old director,</p>

<p>And I laughed when I saw him, despite having no protector.</p>

<p>A wink of his eye and the lack of his lawyers,</p>

<p>Assured I wouldn't be headed to a room full of Destroyers.</p>

<p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,</p>

<p>Giving us myths and excitement and intangible perks.</p>

<p>And laying his finger aside of his ear,</p>

<p>And giving a nod, through the microwave he disappeared.</p>

<p>He sprang to his skiff, with his team to proceed,</p>

<p>And away they all flew, getting set for light speed.</p>

<p>But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of view,</p>

<p>"Happy Sithmas to all, and may the force be with you!"</p>
