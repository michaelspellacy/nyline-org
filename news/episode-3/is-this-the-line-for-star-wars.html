title: Is this the line for Star Wars?
theme: episode-3

	<p>So I'm on the line...I think. But for some reason, it seems different. I'm on a couch, and as far as I can remember, the line has never been so kind to my patoot. Still - there's something familiar about this place. Something technologically terrible, but oh so nice...</p>

	<p>So I guess you get it. I'm posting from the Death Star bus. The Death Star bus that exists. In real life. The Death Star bus that popped out of Geek Squad liason and NYLine member Josh Shabtai's mind and onto 54th Street. The Death Star bus that looks like the Death Star. It's like something out of a dream.</p>

	<p>Suffice to say, I think it's pretty cool. Much more to come, including a roundup of the events of the last two days when I stop getting distracted by the fact that I'm on a bus that looks like the Death Star.</p>
