	<p>How far away is registration? Not far... patience!</p>

	<p>Over the next few days, our crack team of Web site Astromechs will put the finishing touches on a registration system worthy of recognition in the Jedi Archives. Once they've finished, we'll give early notification to subscribers of our <a href="/newsletter/">newsletter</a>, then we'll post all the necessary registration information <a href="/">here</a>.</p>

	<p>Until then, why not check out our <a href="/docs/episode-3-line-schedule.html">fully armed and operational shift schedule</a>? While we're still finalizing the details and descriptions of some of the events, you'll find more than enough information to start planning your line experience.</p>

	<p>Remember, once registration does go live, you'll need to sign up for enough shifts to total 60 points. So it's never too soon to start figuring out when and how you want to spend your time on 54th Street!</p>
