title: Last Chance to see Episode III at the Ziegfeld - 6/28
theme: episode-3
---

	<p>The end of the line has finally come.</p>

	<p>The 10 p.m. showing on Tuesday, June 28 will be the final screening of Episode III at the Ziegfeld. If you've been planning to see it before it gets displaced by "War of the Worlds," now is the time. To coordinate efforts with fellow NYLiners, check out <a href="{{site.boards}}">this thread</a> on our <a href="{{site.boards}}">message boards</a>.</p>

	<p>Yes, it will still be possible to see "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" at NYC theaters as of June 29, and some of those theaters are even equipped with digital projection so we can still view the movie as George Lucas intended. But this is the final opportunity to see Episode III with your friends from NYLine at the home of NYLine. As Yoda would say: "Miss it do not!"</p>
