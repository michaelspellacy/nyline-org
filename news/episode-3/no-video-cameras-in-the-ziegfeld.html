<p>We have been told that <strong>no video cameras will be allowed in the Ziegfeld opening night</strong>, and that anybody who tries to enter carrying a video camera or who is discovered to have one inside will be immediately ejected from the theater. Please help us to avoid any difficulty by leaving your video cameras at home Wednesday night or by arranging to have them stored safely. NYLine will not be able to provide storage opening night.</p>

<p>Thank you for your cooperation!</p>
