<p>The Empire is in retreat, and Luke Skywalker is on a quest to rebuild the Jedi. But before he can revive that elite corps of protectors, he must first rebuild himself! Luke has spent time as the Emperor's thrall, and the taint of the dark side still tugs at his subconcious. If he cannot pull the Jedi together, if he cannot pull <em>himself</em> together, the New Republic may lose the upper hand, and the Empire may take root once more.</p>

<p>The long-awaited second chapter in the biggest <em>Star Wars</em> series of all time is here, in this special limited edition! This 168-page hardcover features an out-of-this-galaxy painting by Cam Kennedy, the signature tip-in plate, and all 12 of Dave Dorman's cover paintings from original two series! The Smythe-sewn binding, foil-stamped bonded-leather cover, and slipcase make this volume a quality book collector's dream!</p>
