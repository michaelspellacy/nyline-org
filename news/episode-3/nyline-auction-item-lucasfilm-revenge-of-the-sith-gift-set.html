<p>The next item in our eBay auction benefiting the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a> is a special one, because it comes from the true rulers of the Republic - our friends at Lucasfilm Ltd. and Steve Sansweet.

You will be bidding on the entire set, which consists of:</p>A 27x40 original double sided <strong>Version A</strong> teaser poster for Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
