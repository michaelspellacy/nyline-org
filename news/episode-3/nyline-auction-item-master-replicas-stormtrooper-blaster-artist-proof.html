	<p>"And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise."</p>

	<p>Well...sometimes. But whatever precision that the troops had can be thanked to their trusty blaster. Our sponsor <strong>Master Replicas</strong>, has kindly donated for our eBay auction benefiting the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>, an exceptionally rare item from their prop replica archives. They have provided us with an <strong>Artist Proof</strong> version of their limited edition <strong>Stormtrooper Blaster</strong>, which has recently sold out from their stock.</p>

	<p>The Stormtroopers were unswervingly loyal to the Emperor and represented the most visible extension of Imperial might. They served both the ground-based armies of Palpatine's forces, and the space-based Imperial starfleet. Formidable in their white armor, their primary means of enforcement was the BlasTech E-11 blaster rifle.</p>

	<p>The prop makers modified the military version of a 1950's British submachine gun to create this blaster prop. To create this fearsome weapon, the prop-makers modified the gun by adding plastic "T-track" to cover the barrel vent holes. A metal strip was bent into shape and attached to the top of the receiver in order to attach a WWII tank azimuth scope. The original 32 round magazine for the submachine gun was shortened to hold three rounds.</p>

	<p>While many different resin stunt Stormtrooper blasters were used during filming, Master Replicas has recreated the metal hero version based upon the blank-firing submachine gun as used in <i>A New Hope</i>. With its heavy, steel construction, our replica weighs almost as much as the actual prop.</p>

	<p><strong>Approximate dimensions: 21" L x 6" W x 9" H. A limited edition of 3,500, this item has recently sold out from Master Replicas.</strong></p>

	<p>A Master Replicas Artist Proof is designated by a special plaque with no release number. Rather, it has "Artist Proof" where the number would normally be. Artist Proofs are generally used internally, as gifts, for marketing and other similar things. Artist Proofs are not sold to the public.</p>

	<p><strong>This item comes with a custom display case, ARTIST PROOF plaque, plaque stand, and certificate of authenticity.</strong></p>
