<p>A Jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But when a Jedi has to defend himself, it's best to do it up right.</p>

<p>That's what I learned after watching <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, and that's what is remarkably demonstrated by our next item for the NYLine eBay auction benefiting the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>. Ordered and donated for us by our amazing sponsor and friends at <a href="http://www.newyorkcostumes.com/">Halloween Adventure</a>, this incredible work of art would be the perfect addition to any true Star Wars collection.</p>

<p>You are bidding on a brand new <strong>Rubies Supreme Edition Collector's Life Size Yoda Replica</strong>.</p>

<img src="img/c2-rubies_yoda.jpg" alt="">

<p>This is a life size statue of Yoda as seen in Star Wars: Episode II. The ancient, revered Jedi Master stands 2' 4" with a 26" high display base. Yoda is made of latex and polyresin, comes clothed with a hooded Jedi robe and stands with lightsaber in hand. Only 10,000 pieces were produced of this limited edition item. The statue includes an individually numbered plaque with a Star Wars: Episode II - <em>Attack of the Clones</em> logo and Certificate of Authenticity.</p>
