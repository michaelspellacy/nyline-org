	<p>The next item up for bids in our eBay auction benefiting the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a> comes from NYLine's resident R2 unit, Michele Hadlow, complete with an interesting story about how she gained custody of these treasures (a tale for another day).</p>

	<p>You are bidding on a unique collection of <strong>9 Sigma Return of the Jedi hand-painted Bisque Porcelain Figurines</strong>. Most of these figurines are incredibly rare and difficult to find. Finding them together is nearly impossible! The figurines vary in height between 5" and 6", and each comes with its original box.</p>

	<p>The only figurines NOT in mint condition are Luke Skywalker (some black paint chipped off right sleeve), Darth Vader (several paint chips off the front), and the Galactic Emperor (some black paint chipped off the throne). None of these figures themselves are chipped, only some of the paint, and the rest of the figurines are in perfect condition. All of the boxes have some worn corners, but other than that are in lovely condition. This is a one-of-a-kind auction opportunity!</p>

	<p>This collection includes:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Luke Skywalker</b></li>
		<li><b>Darth Vader</b></li>
		<li><b>Han Solo</b></li>
		<li><b>Galactic Emperor</b></li>
		<li><b>Princess Leia Organa</b></li>
		<li><b>Bib Fortuna</b> (with "Boba Fett" mistakenly printed on bottom)</li>
		<li><b>Wicket W. Warrick</b></li>
		<li><b>Lando Calrissian</b></li>
		<li><b>C3PO and R2D2</b></li>
	</ul>
