	<p>The collection of autographs culled together by Bart Barenbrug as he travelled Europe featured every generation of Star Wars performer, and even several members of the Star Wars community that have become as beloved to fans as the stars themselves. This lot of items includes autographed photos of the stars of the latest Star Wars smash, <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, and also a special item that Bart picked up for the eBay auction benefiting the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a> at Jedi-Con 2004 in Germany.</p>

	<p>This fantastic lot includes an exclusive action figure set from Jedi-Con '04 of a Clone Trooper and a Super Battle Droid, signed by Gus Lopez, renowned Star Wars collector and founder of the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050429024150/http://www.toysrgus.com:80/collectors.html">www.ToysRGus.com</a> and Steve Sansweet, author, columnist and Lucasfilm liaison to Star Wars fans everywhere. The box has a slight tear in the front of the packaging as pictured. The figures have never been removed from the box. Only 2,500 of these items were produced, and the package comes numbered on the back of the box, 0124 of 2,500.</p>
