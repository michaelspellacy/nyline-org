	<p>Starting on April 21st and running through May 17th, the NYLine will be holding an <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> auction, with all proceeds going directly to the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>, in support of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050404073240/http://www.starlight-newyork.org/_programs/fun_centers.html">Fun Center program</a>. Over the past few months, we've worked our hardest to avoid unloading the same old unmotivated droids when we pull up the sandcrawler. We hope that everyone will be as excited about these items as we are, and we hope to raise skiff loads of cash for Starlight! Throughout the next few weeks we'll be presenting all of the auction items here in preparation for the big kick-off.</p>

	<p>Our first item was presented to the public <a href="articlef52a.html?id=228">earlier</a>. Nathan Sawaya's incredible <a href="articlef52a.html?id=228">40" LEGO sculpture</a> of our mascot, the <a href="/gallery/nyline-liberty-mascot-by-nathan-sawaya.html">Liberty Jedi</a> is the epitome of our organization. It represents the love of New York, Star Wars, and charity which has served us so well over the past 6 years. Make sure to visit our <a href="{{site.boards}}">message boards</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050330034508/http://www.nathanbrickartist.com/liberty_jedi.html">Nathan's site</a> to view even more pictures of this amazing achievement in the brick arts.</p>

	<p>Staying in the same medium, our next item up for bids is an exclusive lot of LEGO Star Wars items from Toy Fair 2005. This set includes:</p>

	<p>On February 19, 2005 LEGO held a V.I.P. Gala for collector media at their New York Showroom to debut their line for Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. Guests were sent a special <strong><i>Star Wars</i> themed New York Toy Fair invitation</strong> to coincide with their 50th anniversary.</p>

	<p>As a special gift to attendees of the gala, LEGO created a limited edition unique slipcase housing the <strong>Darth Vader Transformation set</strong> (#7251). Only 55 of these were produced, which makes this a highly sought-after item.</p>

	<p>The lead designer of the LEGO Star Wars line was also on hand for the event, and graciously signed a beautiful 6' x 3' <strong>LEGO Star Wars poster</strong>, featuring the now iconic image of Darth Vader overlooking a sea of lava. The poster was signed: "2/29/05 Star Wars VIP Gala. Toy Fair NYC. May the force be with you!"</p>
