<p>OK, so it's not exactly the "Orlando Bloom" premiere, but it's the premiere of his new movie <i>Kingdom of Heaven</i> tonight at the Ziegfeld that has caused us to move our beloved NYLine tents down the block, closer to Avenue of the Americas.</p>

<p>So when you arrive for your shifts today, don't panic if you don't see us right away amidst all of the hub-bub of the construction of Orlando's Red Carpet, we're still there! Just down the block a bit.</p>
