<p>We are very excited to announce that anyone around the world can now support the NYLine Stand-A-Thon for the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>, and NYLine members can begin fundraising online thanks to our secure PayPal Donation Link located at <a href="/donate.html">http://www.nyline.org/donate</a>. The only thing needed is a major credit card, and all proceeds go to Starlight, towards their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050404073240/http://www.starlight-newyork.org/_programs/fun_centers.html">Fun Center</a> program. A tax receipt will be sent from Starlight for any donation, as long as a shipping address is entered.</p>

<p>Line members can start soliciting donations on their behalf by sending this link to family, friends, co-workers, acquaintances, cab drivers, droids, and anybody else they've ever come into contact with. As long as the person donating enters the line member's name (and optionally his/her ROTS identification number), the amount they give will be added to that line member's total money raised for Starlight. This number will be used as a part of <a href="how-nyline-works-wheres-your-spot-in-the-line.html">seat determination</a> for the midnight premiere of Revenge of the Sith, as well as puts members in the running for great prizes that we give to our top fundraisers. In addition, money raised online can also be used towards the $60 minimum needed to earn an NYLine III <a href="incentive-t-shirts-the-trilogy-is-now-complete.html">Incentive Shirt</a>!</p>

<p>Of course one does not have to sponsor a line member in order to donate, and we still encourage all NYLiners to print out a Starlight <a href="/pledge.html">Pledge Form</a> and raise money the old fashioned way!</p>

<p>If you hear a sound, off in the distance, that would be me, blowing my Ewok horn to signify the beginning of our fundraising efforts. We want to raise more money this year than we ever have before, and we need your help to do it! I have had the pleasure of being able to witness first hand just how much of an impact these fun centers can have on the well being of hospitalized children. It's...quite the thing to see. This is a cause that is worth fighting for, and we hope that all of our line members get in the trenches with us.</p>

<p>And if someone is visiting this site who is not a member, please donate! The reward would be more wealth than you can imagine...</p>
