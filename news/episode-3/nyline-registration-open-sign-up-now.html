<p>The New York Line is a pathway to many experiences some would consider...unnaturally awesome. And now is your chance to officially sign up for the line, choose which shifts you'll be spending on the sidewalk, and start raising money for the <a href="{{ site.charity }}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>. Do what must be done...Do not hesitate and show no mercy!!</p>

<p>NYLine III: April 30 &ndash; May 19, 2005 at the Ziegfeld Theatre</p>

<p><strong><a href="/register.html">Click here to Register!</a></strong></p>

<p>As in 1999 and 2002, we will be lining up in shifts, so you can choose blocks of time which best fit your schedule. Each shift has a point value assigned to it, based on the difficulty of the shift. Locals have to accumulate 60 points (less if you're coming from outer rim territories) to earn a ticket to the midnight premiere of ROTS. Like the previous lines, you'll find that the time commitment is not Alderaan-shattering. We don't ask the impossible because we want to promote an atmosphere of fun and camaraderie that even the busiest New Yorker can take part in. But if you were to spend a longer time on the line, the reward would be...a better spot in line and a better seat for the movie! Members with the most dedication also will receive special prizes.</p>

<p>Another reason that we want as many people out on the pavement as possible is to get some attention that we can then deflect towards our beloved charity, the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation. We STRONGLY urge all of our line members to raise money on their own via the <a href="/pledge.html">Stand-A-Thon pledge form</a> for Starlight's Fun Center Program. In 2002 we placed 4 Fun Centers in area hospitals and we want to do even better this time! We'll be using our aggressive feelings to convince everyone what a worthy cause this is. And if you're in it for the reward, you'll be happy to know that each dollar raised will count towards your point total which dictates your place in line and your seat in the theater. If that isn't enough, members raising more than $60 will receive this <a href="incentive-t-shirts-the-trilogy-is-now-complete.html">amazing incentive shirt</a>! And of course top fundraisers will also get other special prizes!</p>

<p>If you have ANY questions, email us at <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact@nyline.org</a> or post on our <a href="{{ site.boards }}">messageboards</a>. Also, check the boards for descriptions of the <a href="{{ site.boards }}">great activities</a> we have planned for the line. And remember, we're still accepting donations for our <a href="article1d69.html?id=224">eBay auction for Starlight</a>!</p>

<p>So <a href="/register.html">register</a> for the NYLine...it is your destiny.</p>

<p>It will be a hard line (the ground is made of concrete)<br>But you will find out, who you are.</p>
