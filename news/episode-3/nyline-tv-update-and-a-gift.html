<p>And now to business...</p>

<p>During the final days of the line, the amazing TiVo brothers, Vince Hardy and Steve Lorenzo were able to capture a whole slew of News footage covering our endeavor, while we were all out there experiencing it. Over the past weeks, our two Jedi Knights led a desperate mission to release the captured media so that everyone could enjoy it. And they did it! So head over to the <a href="{{site.video}}">NYLineTV</a> section to see numerous video clips from around the country, and perhaps you'll find that you made the cut yourself!</p>

<p>And finally, something that every one of us will want to experience. We were sent a link to an audio clip that a fan recorded of the crowd reaction during the opening credits of Episode III from our midnight show. If this does not induce goosebumps, then you are indeed more machine than man. So turn down your lights, close your eyes, and bring yourself back...again and again...</p>
