<p>NYLine is proud to announce that <a href="http://www.theonion.com/"">The Onion</a> newspaper has become a 2005 sponsor of our Stand-A-Thon for the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation! Every week for the past 15 years, three million readers have turned to this popular humor publication for a much-needed dose of Onion satire and entertainment coverage.</p>

<p>In this week's issue, a <strong><a href="channels/2005/docs/NYLineOnionAd.pdf">stunning ad</a></strong> is featured on page 15 with the Statue of Liberty and Yoda wielding their lightsabers and the catch phrase <strong>"Waiting for the Release of Star Wars: Episode III in May? So are we. Join us on the sidewalk."</strong> In addition, the NYLine ad will be included in The Onion Events eNewsletter which will feature a special contest for two tickets to the opening night screening of Episode III at the Ziegfeld Theatre.</p>

<p>During the actual Stand-A-Thon, The Onion newspaper will also be available for all line members and Onion t-shirts will be awarded as contest prizes.</p>
