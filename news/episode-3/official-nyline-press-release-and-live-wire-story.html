	<p>NYLine not only raises money for the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation - we also work to raise awareness of the organization's mission - <em>brightening the lives of seriously ill children and their families. </em></p>

	<p>During the lines in 1999 and 2002, 90% of the 650 stories on the NYLine made note of our fundraising efforts on behalf of Starlight. In 2005, there have already been 21 news features on the NYLine and we haven't even started lining up!!</p>

	<p>One recent, extremely positive <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/livewire/000372.php">story </a>was featured on <strong>Live Wire</strong>, an NYU news wire that many newspapers in New York City and around the coutry subscribe to.</p>
