	<p>Pictures from Day 2 and 3 have been added for your viewing pleasure. Yesterday was fairly quiet compared to the madness of opening day. Kelloggs, an official sponsor of the NYLine, supplied a well balanced (of the force) and nutritious breakfast for all the line folks as games of Epic Duels, Star Wars LIFE and Monopoly got underway.</p>

	<p>This morning we set up for out first weekday shift and were paid a vist by Channel 7 Eyewitness News. Mad props to Marvin the Camera Guy for helping me up! (I fell back in a lawn chair) </p>

	<p>You can check out both days <a href="/gallery/">here</a>!</p>
