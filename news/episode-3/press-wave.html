	<p>With one week under our collective belts, the 2005 NYLine is gearing up to be the best one yet! Generous donations from our members, sponsors and those gracious pedestrians that have visited our home on 54<sup>th</sup> Street have been adding up! It's hard to believe that in just 10 days, we'll all be in the Ziegfeld presenting a check to Starlight with the money raised in our Stand-A-Thon.</p>

	<p>The press coverage for our final NYLine has also been extremely positive. While some reporters still insist on covering the "geek" angle of <em>Star Wars</em> fandom (my favorite question so far: Do you sleep in <em>Star Wars</em> pajamas?), many of us have noticed that most of the press, this time around, seem to finally understand the who, what, where, when, why, and how of our Stand-A-Thon.</p>

<p>One feature that aired this past Tuesday on <em>Eyewitness News, Channel 7</em> encapsulated so well the dedication and uniqueness of Star Wars fans and captured the positive impact that our fundraising has had on children in area hospitals served by the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation. We hope to make this clip available soon on our site.</p>
