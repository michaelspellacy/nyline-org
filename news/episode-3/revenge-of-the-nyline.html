<img src="img/rots_logo.jpg" align="right" />It's official, folks! The title for Episode III was announced yesterday at Comic-Con International in San Diego. We here at NYLine think it rocks! I think it might be time to pull the old exclusive incentive <a href="articlee8f5.html?id=152">t-shirts</a> out for another go around.</p>

<p>With a title like "Revenge of the Sith", it's gonna make waiting 297 days sooooo much more harder. Sigh.</p>
