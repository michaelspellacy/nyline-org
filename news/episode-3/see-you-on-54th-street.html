	<p>Every Saga has a final chapter, and NYLine's begins in 12 hours.</p>

	<p>The forecast calls for rain, but that's nothing we haven't dealt with before. In fact, we'll be much better prepared for bad weather than we ever were in 1999 or 2002!</p>

	<p>Rain or shine, the first shift begins at 11 a.m. Sign in for the shift and you'll receive your badge and your NYLine Welcome Kit, which you'll find is full of surprises. At noon, we'll officially start the countdown clock. The rest of the day will be for getting to know your fellow line members, first through the NYLine video diaries during Shift 2, then at the Outlander Club Party, DJ'd by NYC's "Star Wars" Breakbeats master, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050404034552/http://www.suckadelic.com/">Suckadelic</a>!</p>

	<p>It will be a day long remembered... See you on the sidewalk!</p>
