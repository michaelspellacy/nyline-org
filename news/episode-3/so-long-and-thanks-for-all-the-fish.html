			<h1>So long and thanks for all the Fish...</h1>

			<p class="current-members">Number of people currently in line: 41</p>

	<p>Here we are. The end of the line. The day we have all been waiting for is finally here. "Almost There" is now, well...HERE! 18 months of planning by fellow staff members and all the hard work of our line members shall be realized tonight at 12:01 AM. It's going to be glorious!</p>

	<p>Tomorrow is sure to be fun, but hectic, as premiere days usually are. With that in mind, here are a couple of friendly reminders for all you folks that are attending:</p>

	<p>1. We are suggesting that all of our line members get to the Ziegfeld by 7:00 PM.</p>

	<p>2. Don't forget your line badge. You won't be let in early without it!</p>

	<p>3. No recording devices are allowed inside the theater, so please leave them home. Digital Cameras are okay. However, I would consider a camera or phone that can record small segments of video a no-no. Being realistic, we know it will be virtually impossible for staff at the Zieg to check for such a thing, so you are kind of on the honor system there. Take as many pics as you want before and after the film...just no video.</p>

	<p>Here we go again, folks...it's Star Wars time! Oh YEAH!</p>
