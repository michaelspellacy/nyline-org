	<p>With the start of the <a href="http://www.liningup.net/">Los Angeles Line</a>, the mainstream media have returned to "Star Wars" fandom in full force.</p>

	<p>And even though we don't hit 54th Street for another three weeks, national media coverage of NYLine has begun. In a story on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032542/site/newsweek/">Newsweek.com</a>, NYLine is mentioned as one of the organizations <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7430664/site/newsweek/">"Putting the Hype in Hyperspace"</a>:</p>
<em>New Yorkers will begin lining up for the movie on April 30 at the historic Ziegfield Theater on 54th Street, according to "NYLine" organizer Jewels Green, who like her Hollywood counterparts is also raising money for charity. </em>


	<p>Fortunately, we can report that the <a href="article2b36.html?id=227">Ziegfeld does have Episode III confirmed</a>, and right now the only way you can guarantee yourself a ticket to the midnight premiere of "Revenge of the Sith" May 19 is to <a href="/register.html">join NYLine</a>!</p>

	<p>Best of luck to our brothers and sisters on the West Coast; May the Force Be With You at the Chinese Theater!</p>
