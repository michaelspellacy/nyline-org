	<p>As outlined in <a href="articleed7c.html?id=236">this story</a>, NYLine members will be let into the Ziegfeld based on their point totals - one point for each dollar raised for the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation, with that number added to the number of shift points earned throughout the line. Using figures entered into our tracking system as of Saturday, our top 10 point totals stand at:</p>
<ul>
<li>1028 
<li>825 
<li>672 
<li>600 
<li>585 (3 members) 
<li>583 
<li>490 
<li>485 
<li>443 
<li>380</li></ul>
	<p>Our top 5 shift point earners stand at:</p>
<ul>
<li>878 
<li>525 
<li>433 
<li>365 
<li>350</li></ul>
	<p>And our top 5 fundraisers have turned in:</p>
<ul>
<li>$507 
<li>$500 
<li>$460 (2 members) 
<li>$450</li></ul>
	<p><!--StartFragment --><SPAN class=q>The top shift point earners and fundraisers also will be awarded prizes opening night. It's not too late to increase your totals and move yourself closer to the front of the line - you have approximately 48 more hours to <a href="/docs/nyline-3-starlight-pledge-form.pdf">collect money from Stand-A-Thon sponsors</a> or to come on down to 54th Street and spend some more time on the line!</p>

	<p><SPAN class=q>Be sure to check that we have tallied all of your points correctly by logging into the <a href="/login.html">NYLine Members area</a>. If you feel that there is some discrepancy, email us at <a href="mailto:contact@nyline.org">contact@nyline.org</a>.</p>
