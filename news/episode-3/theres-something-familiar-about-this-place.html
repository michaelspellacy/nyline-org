	<p>I'm standing on the street in midtown Manhattan. It's the middle of the night. It's completely quiet, well as quiet as a NYC street gets. I'm standing alone. It's cold, it's raining.............I'm home.</p>

	<p>Hot choclate, hot dogs, lightsabers a plenty and  "I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle" starring Anthony Daniels.</p>

	<p>Ya gotta love it.</p>
