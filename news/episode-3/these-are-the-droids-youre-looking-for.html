<p>It's not even May, but Friday night you'll have a chance to see Episode III at the Ziegfeld, surrounded by fellow "Star Wars" fans!</p>

<p>In a true preview of things to come, NYLine members will return to 54<sup>th</sup> Street on March 11 for the 9:30 p.m. screening of "Robots." The evening's main event will be two minutes of Sithly goodness in the form of the Episode III trailer, which informally kicks off the 2005 NYLine festivities.</p>

<p>Once the movie lets out, it'll be exactly 49 days and 12 hours until NYLine III begins! If you're thinking about joining us for the first time, be sure to look for the crowd wearing <a href="pic2c89.html?line=2&img=2002/news/nyline_tshirt_lrg.jpg" alt="">Liberty Jedi</a> t-shirts. We'll be scouting our favorite stretch of New York City sidewalk after the film, so come on over and say "hi." Or "yub nub," if you're so inclined.</p>

<p>Sure, you can save the $10 and catch the trailer 24 hours earlier by watching for a commercial break during "The O.C." on Fox, but what self-respecting "Star Wars" fans want their first real glimpse of the final chapter in the saga to be on a tiny TV screen? </p>

<p>See you at the Ziegfeld!</p>
