<p>We here at NYLine are pleased to announce that we now have the green light to line up in front of the Ziegfeld Theater once again! A tentative line schedule is also now <a href="/docs/episode-3-line-schedule.html">available</a> for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>NYLine will again be lining up to raise money for the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>. To date, we have raised nearly $33,000 for Starlight. Most impressive. Hopefully we can go out with a bang this time around. Bigger than a Death Star explosion with any luck. 

<p>Better start planning those days off now! If you loved the first two lines, you are going to have a blast on this one! This is the LAST line for a Star Wars movie and we are making plans for a sidewalk event that will be long remembered.</p>

<p>Here we go again!</p>
