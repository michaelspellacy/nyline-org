	<p>Look at the size of that thing!</p>

	<p>The Geek Squad bus is now a reality. To those of us who remember the 1999 NYLine camp, which consisted of some chairs and a bunch of tarps held up by lightsabers, our current presence on 54th Street is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p>

	<p>Words fail to describe its awesome power. Quite honestly, so do pictures. If you've been looking for an excuse to come down to the Ziegfeld, this is it!</p>
