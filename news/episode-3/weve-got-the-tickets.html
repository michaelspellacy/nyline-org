<DIV>It has been a crazy day to say the least, but the end result is that at roughly 3:00 this afternoon, NYLine's Suzanne Sousa walked out of the Ziegfeld Theatre offices clutching a manila envelope that contained a very large number of tickets for the midnight premiere of Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith on May 19th! The fact that tickets became available today caught everyone by surprise, but our friends at Clearview stayed true to their word and had the block of tickets for NYLine members set aside for us.</DIV>

<DIV>We have some slots left open before we reach our 350 member limit, so if you haven't done so already, <a href="/register.html">sign up now</a>!! When we say that we guarantee a ticket for every line member who earns 60 points (which can done by waiting in shifts of your choice for as little as 12 hours), we mean it! Your ticket to the ultimate Star Wars event party is waiting in our hands, so <a href="/register.html">register now</a>, help raise money for the <a href="{{site.charity}}">Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation</a>, and enjoy this last of its kind experience of watching a Star Wars premiere with 1200 of your closest friends!</DIV></DIV>
