<p>So what does it take to organize an outdoor, 19-day event?  Blood, sweat, tears, a strong back, 13 meetings and 5,645 e-mails! To be a staff member of the NYLine is a commitment not easily broken just like the Jedi order. 18 multi-talented individuals from all walks of life focused on one goal &ndash; to celebrate the final film in the Star Wars saga with a last-of-its-kind sidewalk party, all as a benefit for the Starlight Starbright Children's Foundation.</p>

	<p>We have met with over a hundred vendors, corporations and individuals asking (sometime begging) for supplies, prizes, auction items, toys, and monetary donations for our Starlight Stand-A-Thon. As the picture below shows, my apartment is temporary storage space for white boards, storage clipboards, weight bags (- sand), tarps, cord protectors and even our prime auction prize &ndash; Lady Liberty Jedi constructed entirely of LEGO's (you can barely see her crown through the bubble wrap in the box to the left of Yoda.)  This scene is repeated in the apartments and work places of many NYLine staff members.</p>

	<p>But the NYLine would be nothing without the Star Wars fans coming in from nine countries, twenty states and our beloved New York City. What has sustained the NYLine staff members over the past year and a half of planning is the mere thought of enjoying the last Star Wars movie celebration of its kind with fellow fans, friends and family at the Ziegfeld!</p>
