	<p>They say that there's no such thing as bad press. But when you're waiting in line for a kids movie to open in three weeks and tickets went on sale a few days before you even hit the pavement, there's an opportunity for your message to end up somewhere deep within the pit of Carkoon. However, with help from our amazing PR royalty Suzanne Sousa and Jewels Green, NYLine III has received freighter-loads of amazingly positive press. And these are not the local bulk cruisers, mind you &ndash; I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. The most impressive of these was a segment that ran on ABC's Eyewitness News and we've heard was eventually picked up nationally. Encompassing every angle of what we're doing and why, we thought it was perfect enough that we wanted to share it, so everyone on the sidewalk with us knows that there are people out there who just get it.</p>
