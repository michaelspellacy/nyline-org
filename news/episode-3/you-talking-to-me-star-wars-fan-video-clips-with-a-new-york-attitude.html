	<p>After nearly a two-year effort to compile video documentation from both private and media sources, NYLine is proud to announce an expansion of its <a href="{{site.video}}">NYLine TV video gallery</a>. NYLine will post new video clips and mini-movies on a regular basis till the end of 2006 from all three of its legendary Stand-A-Thons in 1999, 2002 and 2005.</p>

	<p>It's only fitting that our expanded video showcase include an awesome assortment of goodies from last year's Stand-A-Thon at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City and Celebration III in Indianapolis. For your viewing pleasure, the new videos include the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="{{site.video}}">Celebration III: Congratulations to the NYLine from Star Wars cast members & LEGO Star Destroyer Competition</a></li>
		<li><a href="{{site.video}}#specials">Top NYLine Fundraiser, David Evans's video homage to the NYLine</a></li>
		<li><a href="{{site.video}}#news">Opening night coverage from NBC Nightly News and CNN on the Big Screen</a></li>
		<li><a href="{{site.video}}#tvhilite">Binside TV interview with NYLiner Freddie Crespo and Star Wars Italian Style</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>The one and only, Vince Hardy, deserves special recognition for his relentless drive to get as much NYLine video coverage posted on the web site in the best quality possible. In other words, VINCE HARDY ROCKS or as Padme says with teary eyes in the Special Edition of Episode II..."I truly, deeply love...Vince Hardy."</p>

	<p>Stay tuned for more video clips in the months ahead!</p>
