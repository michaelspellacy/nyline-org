	<p>Cool Say-dee, was born on the net, lives on the net and only exists in virtual cyberspace. On rare occasions she ventures out into the "real world". So it was a fab occasion that Cool Say-dee, the ultimate queen of Japicity, came to join the NY Line to give her support to the Starlight Children's Foundation in raising money and awareness for this wonderful organization.</p>

	<p>Say-dee is a humungous fan of Star Wars. "This is the real deal." She wants to give a big shout out to the Star Wars legions of fans.</p>

	<p>"This is so like the coolest movie event of the year. The fans are totally awesome. We have all bonded on the line and know that these friendships will be lasting and forever. We share food, make-up tips, yo-yo techniques and now sleeping bags. Excuse me, we take shifts. If the world could come together like the New York Line, it would be truly a great and loving place."</p>

	<p>Our motto is: Stay Cool, Stay Up!!! Star Wars Forever. The Force rules.</p>
