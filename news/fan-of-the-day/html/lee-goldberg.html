<p>Not many television meteorologists would be willing to do their forecast wearing an Admiral Ackbar mask. However, WABC-TV's Lee Goldberg was willing to expose to his viewers that he is indeed a die-hard "Star Wars" fan.</p>

<p>Goldberg broadcast all his forecasts Sunday morning from the NYLine, chatting with fans and sharing a few of his favorite toys his own collection, including a 12" Princess Leia in her "Return of the Jedi" slave outfit, and Kenner X-wing fighter.</p>

<p>"This is the first time I've released the fact that I collect the toys," Goldberg said. "had them when I was younger, and I started collecting them again about five years ago."</p>

<p>Goldberg did not see "Star Wars" in its original theatrical release because her was too young; however, by the time "the Empire Strikes Back" hit theaters, he was already exhibiting signs that hinted at an obsession with both Star Wars and meteorology.</p>

<p>"The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite of the three," Goldberg said. "I loved Hoth; it had the most abusive weather. The wind chill must have been at least 200 below zero."</p>

<p>Though New York's wind chills in January aren't quite as fierce, Goldberg braved them in 1997 to line up for the "Star Wars" Special Edition at the Ziegfeld Theatre. Because of his experience seeing the trilogy at the Ziegfeld, he said he wouldn't see "Episode I" anywhere else.</p>

<p>"This is the atmosphere you want to be in," Goldberg said, "Any movie with this type of sound and special effects should be seen here."</p>

<p>As for the atmosphere outside the Ziegfeld Tuesday night, Goldberg said conditions could get a little damp just about the time crowds will gathering for the midnight showing.</p>

<p>"My biggest fear is that if it rains, it's going to be late Tuesday night," Goldberg said. "If that happens, I'll be hiding in a Darth Maul costume."</p>
