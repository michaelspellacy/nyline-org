	<p>Jewels Sem, a recent addition to the volunteer staff for the New York Line Countdown saw Star Wars at the tender age of six, and has never been the same since. Her earliest Star Wars memories include pretending Matchbox cars were landspeeders, wishing she has as many action figures as her cousing Jody, and dreaming of growing up to be as strong, sexy, and sassy as Princess Leia.</p>

	<p>Jewels works full-time as a Systems Specialist (read: Professional Computer Geek) for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and volunteers as Media Assistant, Skit Extra, and Yo-Yo Goddess for the NYLine. Affectionately known by her colleagues on the NYLine staff as "Dewels" she has also earned the nickname "Trivia Queen" and will fiercely defend her title against all challengers.</p>

	<p>For Jewels, Star Wars represents the ultimate amalgam of what Joseph Campbell so aptly called "The Power of Myth". Forget fables and fairy tales, Star Wars is where she, and many of the rest of us, learned good from evil, rooted for a real hero, and fell in love with classical music for the first time.</p>

	<p>Although not an official collector of memorabilia (she keeps none of her Star Wars accoutrements in their original wrappings, preferring to play with them instead), she does, however, pay an aging Jedi Master to guard her humble handmade ceramic R2-D2 nightlight with a cheap plastic lightsaber and an Army-Navy stun gun. A hopeless romantic, Jewels has dedicated her time on the New York Line to her beloved departed German Shepherd/Collie, Princess Leia Myers (1978-1993) and if you watch closely, you'll catch her get all misty-eyed as soon as the fanfare begins at 12:01 am May 19.</p>
