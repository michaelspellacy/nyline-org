	<p>Suzanne is dynamic go-getter and a woman of many talents. A native of New Jersey, she is the middle child of two brothers. She first saw Star Wars when she was five and has loved the film ever since. She has watched the trilogy dozens of times and has a copy of the Star Wars Christmas Special that aired in 1977. Mostly a collector of books and artwork for the series, she is exquisitely well-versed in all that is Star Wars. Rumor has it she has worked long and hard at hiding her only deep, dark Star Wars secret: she's a closet Ewok lover.</p>

	<p>A woman with purpose and vision, Suzanne has become an invaluable member of the NYLine Countdown team. She works as a volunteer for the team as Assistant Line Coordinator and Media Relations Contact. Her diligence, hard work, and leadership abilities has earned her the nickname "PR Princess." This is partly due to her ability to charm the pants off a Wookie (oops they don't wear pants) and instantly take charge of chaotic, often delicate situations (not unlike the creative management styling of that other famous Princess). Her tenacity has won her the respect and admiration of all of the NYLine volunteers and sponsors. She knows how to get the job done and she does is well.</p>

	<p>Suzanne is no stranger to volunteer work. For two years during college she became a volunteer for the AmeriCorps and did so with drive and passion. She volunteered regularly and became a great asset to them in getting donations and coordinating various events. She learned how to coax the press for coverage and solicit sponsors to donate various items to provide for the other youths volunteering. Surrendering to wanderlust, Suzanne has done some traveling--to her native Portugal as well as to Brazil. She also speaks fluent Portuguese and Spanish.</p>

	<p>One of the many things that Suzanne so cool, amazing, inspiring, and special is that she can FLY. She spent last summer fiercely studying at the Teterboro Flight School (aka Airfleet) to get her private pilot's license. This past November, she became the first pilot in her family. She is now poised to embark on advanced training that will enable her to fly at night and in all types of weather. As if this weren't amazing enough, she's also won three scholarships: one from Airfleet, one from the New Jersey Private Pilot association and the last from "The 99's" (a woman's pilot organization started by Amelia Earhart in the 1920's and which only a very select honor students can participate.) "The 99's" scholarship covers 90% of her schooling costs and helps her to continue her aviation education (can't wait to get her in an X-wing)!</p>

	<p>Suzanne is definitely a woman to be reckoned with and a dear friend to many of us at the NYLine Countdown team. We love her dearly and would not trade for all the credits in the galaxy...just don't mention the hair thing she is liable to pull your arm right out of the socket (just kidding). So our hats off to Suzanne Sousa truly a princess in her own right.</p>
