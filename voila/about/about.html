    <br>
    Voila is a European and International portal provided by 
    France Telecom. France Telecom is one of the world's leading 
    telecommunications carriers with operations in more than 
    50 countries. Voila is a network of local portals in 7 languages: 
    English www.voila.com, Danish www.dk.voila.com, Dutch www.nl.voila.com, 
    French www.voila.fr, Italian www.it.voila.com, Portuguese 
    www.pt.voila.com, Spanish www.es.voila.com.<br>
    <br>
    Voila is the answer to a booming Internet European market, 
    which forecasts 100 million Internet users by the end of 
    the year 2000. Its Mission Statement consists in offering 
    European audiences comprehensive and accurate content-using 
    leading-edge search tools-with a local community focus.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Voila.com: Your Ticket to the U.S.</b> <br>
    Although local content and services are key to consumers, 
    a European network of portals would not be complete without 
    providing access to the wealth of American content. A gateway 
    to the U.S. through Voila.com will complete the European 
    user experience and open the doors to the entire World Wide 
    Web. Users can connect to Voila.com through their European 
    Voila site. That is why Voila.com is the perfect site for 
    American content providers and advertisers to get their 
    messages heard among the growing number of European Internet 
    users. <br>
    <br>
    <b>State-of-the-Art Search Tools and Local Content</b> <br>
    Voila makes two promises: Visitors will have access to comprehensive 
    and accurate search tools, and they will get the local content 
    in their language. In every country, with local partners, 
    Voila is developing an Integrated Directory and Search Service, 
    providing both the targeted information of a Web directory 
    and the exhaustive information of a powerful search tool. 
    With the most comprehensive European search engine, Voila 
    has already been chosen by Netscape and Microsoft as one 
    of the Premier Providers for search services to their portals 
    in six European countries. Voila has also been selected 
    by Bell Canada as the default search engine on the French 
    version of their leading portal Sympatico (voila.carrefour.net). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Voila provides access to more than 100 million international 
    URLs, including files, images, sound, and domains, which 
    are continuously being updated. Designed by France Telecom 
    in cooperation with Echo -a French Internet start-up company- 
    the Voila search engine was developed using the high-performance 
    and scalable Linux Operating System. <br>
    <br>
    To complement the key-word search engine functionality, 
    Voila has developed thematic search engines to fill the 
    gap between traditional search engines and web directories. 
    These thematic databases allow users to perform extremely 
    accurate searches of well-defined subjects with optimum 
    accuracy and minimum irrelevancy. This one-of-a-kind "theme" 
    technology was developed by the CNET, France Telecom's R&amp;D; 
    Center. Currently, you can experience our Star Wars thematic 
    search engine at www.voila.com/NYline. <br>
