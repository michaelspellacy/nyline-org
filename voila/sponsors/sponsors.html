    and general movie making know-how to create a company 
    that would be different from the others. We are not 
    opposed to making a huge budget video but we also 
    enjoy making smaller videos for smaller bands.</font></p>

    we approach the 21st century we are slowly expanding. 
    Our website knowledge is growing, our videos are being

    to get our own feature film project off the ground. 
    Even though we love doing independent videos and features, 
    we're not opposed to doing high budget projects. We 
    want to be involved in anything we can in the creative 
    process of videos, films, websites and so forth. No 
    job is too big, no fee is too big and that's how we 
    have always looked at it.</font></p>
